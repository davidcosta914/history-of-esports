# Chapter 32 - The Cyber X Games (2004)

The Cyber X Games in Las Vegas was one of the major events of 2004.

They were "announced as a revolutionary tournament for *Counter-Strike*, *Warcraft 3*, *Unreal Tournament 2003* and other games with over $600,000 in prize money for all games," wrote D.Devil on TeamLiquid.

"Chris Hill and his father, Joe Hill, organized Cyber X Games whose initial event was held at CES [Consumer Electronics Show] in Las Vegas from January 8-11th in 2004," wrote Mark "jESUIT" Cheben on ESEANews.com. “In total $260,00 was to be given away to [*Counter-Strike*] competitors at the event and CXG boasted ATI, AMD and Sennheiser as official sponsors. Joe Hill, with his experience in marketing, sold the event and took care of the sponsor booths. Chris’s responsibility was to organize and run the tournaments.”

Microsoft was another big name sponsor for CXG.

"When we first arrived at CXG on Wednesday morning, we were presented with a very swell structured event," wrote Midway for Gotfrag. “The sponsors booths were impressive, and the actual BYOC [Bring Your Own Computer] area was already laid out. The event featured a front stage with a great audio and video system, providing what we hoped would be an excellent tournament for on-site spectators. The tournament systems were top of the line as were many other aspects of the event setup. Considering that CXG began setup a little over 24 hours prior to our arrival, we were impressed with their efforts. But setting up an event and running a tournament are two wholly different matters.”

By the end of the weekend, CXG would earn its place as one of the biggest esports disasters of the era.

On Wednesday night, the PCs had not been fully unpacked nor had the proper software been installed.  CXG would end up needing to borrow and beg attendees for copies of the games being played. Registration was slow and flawed, missing several teams. Seeding had to be redone several times to account for the poor registration process.

"The spotlight game of the tournament, *Counter-Strike*, had only three matches played in the first day of the event after significant delays resulting from cabling and Internet and Steam-related issues," wrote Midway. “There were reports that Steam was being DDoSed [a denial of service attack] during that night. The extent and cause of the Steam-related issues throughout the event however, are unconfirmed. Regardless, the largest impact upon all of the tournaments being run at CXG was a lack of tournament preparation. Specifically there was no tournament schedule for every game except *Warcraft 3*, and an understaffing at the event.”

On Saturday, a meeting was called with "key members of the *CS* community to discuss the tournament delays and how the event might move forward." Prominent figures such as Team 3D’s Craig "Torbull" Levine volunteered their expertise to try to save the event.

Problems persisted. The bandwidth available was extremely low and only two matches could be played at a time. The tournament would progress at a terribly slow pace.

On Thursday evening, Valve’s Steam service was shut down for four hours.

Valve director of marketing Doug Lombardi spoke with GameSpot and said that the outage was caused by a "device failure on our network followed a power outage."

"Steam was also also the subject of a denial of service attack," wrote Tor Thorson for GameSpot. “The timing of the outage compounded the problem, since Valve had released a Steam update on Wednesday night which the hundreds of competitors in the tournament needed to download.”

With 50 *Counter-Strike* matches remaining, it was obvious that the tournament would not be completed. Joe Hill cancelled the *CS* tournament. In its place, a series of exhibition matches would be played for a reduced amount of prize money. However, these were delayed as well and not all matches were played.

"Ironically, further problems awaited the 22 teams--many of which had flown in from Europe--excluded from the exhibition matches," wrote Thorson for GameSpot. “According to a member of A-Losers.MSI, a German team invited to play in a cancelled $2,000 match, CXG officials initially told all *CS* team members that their ‘expenses will be completely compensated’. However, one hour later, the A-Losers were told that only their hotel costs would be partially reimbursed.”

"The mood grew uglier and uglier by the hour," wrote Midway. “Joe Hill and every CXG admin were constantly surrounded by players, spectators, and parents demanding answers. Tempers flared and more than a few heated words were offered to CXG staff. By Sunday afternoon, the last hour of the event loomed, and the situation went from a failure to a catastrophe.”

CXG blamed Steam for further problems throughout the weekend. Valve officially rebuffed the statements, stating that Steam had no further downtime.

"Joe Hill committed to reimbursing teams for their travel expenses," wrote jESUIT. “However, Craig ‘Torbull’ Levine, the former manager of Team 3D, says that never happened and that Team 3D never received money from CXG. The culmination of the event was the power being shut off in the middle of the CoD semi-finals lower bracket match ending the tournament prematurely. The teams who remained split the prize purse equally with zfz receiving an extra $200 for winning the upper bracket.

"In addition, CXG promised to announce more events for 2004 including events in Berlin and Chicago. These never materialized. CXG also promised a ‘partnership with a television production organization that will guarantee primary event coverage as part of a one-hour show format scheduled for broadcast weekly on national and international channels’ in their post-event press release."

Gotfrag’s CXG post-mortem spoke vaguely about the Hill’s ideas about where the blame lay.

"Mr. Hill also apologized for the outcome of the event and accepted responsibility while simultaneously indicating that, in his opinion, there were outside forces at work," wrote Midway, “naming prominent figures in the competitive gaming scene. GotFrag cannot substantiate any of those claims and will not publish them here without supporting proof.”

It soon became obvious that the names were related to the CPL.

"They [the Hills] also went on to accuse the CPL of sabotaging their event," wrote jESUIT, “going so far as to refusing to use any games that have a ‘direct promotional partnership with the CPL organization.’”

"I’ll just say that in my 3+ years of competitive gaming, Recon [Chris Hill] is by far the worst admin I’ve ever met in my life," wrote dz.Vai, an *Unreal Tournament 2003* competitor. “Going to a CXG event was about as cool as eating class and the only prize I wanted before I walked out was to punch Recon in the face.”

In the end, many teams and players travelled all the way to Las Vegas for no reason. Prize money is not distributed. 

Over $160,000 remains unpaid to competitors. The fate of the money is unclear as of this point. Community speculation points squarely to the Hill’s pockets. This is the obvious default conclusion but this accusation remains speculation. 

In a 2004 apology on ESReality.com, Chris Hill claimed that his failed esports ventures had cost his family "a little over 1.7 million dollars."

What follows are relevant selections from Hill’s apology letteer with spelling exactly as Hill typed it.

"Now most of you hate me and I relize why," wrote Hill just three months after CXG. “Things went wrong and certain companies didn't do what they promised for us (CXG). This caused total break down of CXG. I also take into heart the amount of money and time people wasted perparing for CXG and coming to Las Vegas. It was hard on the community and hard on the players to recover from such a dissapointing lan. I personally feel that things were set up correctly and professionaly.

"It took one minor thing to knock it all off track. Well this is why I am writing. I want to apologize for any part of CXG that went wrong on my part. I have been running it through my head for a little over 6 months now and I feel horrible that things didn't go as promised. I am a man at the age of 23 years old and I will take the torrment that is being handed to me from the community and I will take the threats and name calling but I assure you that no one in my family walked away from this tournament in the green. In fact it was very much the opposite. Things have been very rough for my parents and I. I have sinced moved away from them to relieve the finacial burden of taking care of another family member in the house. I have also changed my IRC name a couple times to dodge the harrassment of IRC PM's."

After the disastrous event, several sponsors were scared off from esports. AMD had previously sponsored numerous esports ventures worldwide from *StarCraft* to *Counter-Strike*. The CXG is credited for scaring AMD off from esports for a significant time.

Chris Hill remains involved in esports. As of 2010, he was working in the *Call of Duty* scene developing rules and competitive standards for *Call of Duty: Black Ops* for CEVO leagues.
