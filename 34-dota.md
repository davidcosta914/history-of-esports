# Chapter 34 - Defense of the Ancients (2003-2009)

The fading of the *Warcraft 3* competitive scene can be credited to various factors.

One of the major factors at play was the development and popularity of *Defense of the Ancients* (*DotA*). *DotA* is a custom game built on the *Warcraft* engine (based on a similar custom game from *StarCraft*) in which each team of heroes (a single hero is controlled by a player) fights to destroy the opposing team’s "Ancients". Ancients are heavily defended structures at opposing ends of the map. 

*DotA* shares certain key characteristics with *Herzog Zwei*, the proto-RTS from 1989 in which you controlled and customized a single unit en route to your goal.

Stewardship of the *DotA* mod passed from designers Eul (who coined the name of the game) to Guinsoo (who expanded the game and pushed *DoTA* toward a PvP emphasis) from its inception in 2003 to 2005. Over a dozen developers volunteered to work under Guinsoo to continue building and improving the game.

In 2004, organized competition took shape in the growing *DotA* scene thanks hugely to *DotA*-Allstars.com (from Clan *DotA* Allstars) and the International Gaming Syndicate. The competitive side of the game took hold in Europe and North America first, spawning dozens of top tier teams and leagues that would drive the growth of the game. 

In 2005, *DotA* passed to the most famous head designer the game has had in IceFrog, still a publicly anonymous figure to this day despite the massive popularity of his work.

"It was IceFrog that turned *DoTA* into a beautifully balanced machine," said Machinma.com’s All Your History series. “Under IceFrog’s leadership, *DoTA* soon acquired a level of polish usually reserved for AAA commercial products.”

Under IceFrog, the game’s player base exploded.

"What IceFrog did was on a different level," wrote Player13 on Reddit.com/r/*DoTA*2. “You could tell he owned it. It was like his baby, even though he was just an adoptive father. The rumors of lack of interpersonal skills and shyness don't surprise me, because he's refined the map like one of those reclusive geniuses refines an all-encompassing math theorem. He balanced the map, and took it from having a niche league scene to an internationally recognized competitive game. He made tournament play possible with his balance fixes, made gameplay enjoyable with his bug fixes, and released some way cool heroes.”

*DotA* followed in the hallowed footsteps of fan creations such as *Counter-Strike* when it was adopted by major esports tournaments including WCG, BlizzCon, ESL and CAL. Its popularity in Europe was surpassed only by the explosive zeal of Chinese fans. All of Asia, especially South Eastern Asian nations such as the Philippines, would soon fall under *DotA*’s spell. By 2006, the Chinese *DotA* scene was emerging from its "embryonic" state. It would become the most powerful and populated in the world. 

"During the period of time between [versions] 6.27 and 6.32 [in 2006], Chinese *DotA* developed quickly," wrote CtChocula for GosuGamers.net. “It became the most popular map on college campuses. Not merely did it grow rapidly in numbers of players, but large amounts of EU/NA tournament replays and hero guides flooded into China. High quality forum posts and hero guides began to emerge in large numbers. The level of Chinese *DotA* began a speedy ascent.”

The CPL hosted a landmark *DotA* event in China that year, showcasing the growing fanaticism and talent of the *DotA* players in the region.

Jonathan "Loda" Berg is a Swedish *DotA* legend. Just ask his fans. Better yet, just ask him. A quick Google search for the Swede star reveals a consistent M.O. throughout his most prominent interviews.

>I’m awesome to the max.

>I do get my fair share of the ladies.

>I just want to say that we are Swedes, we are hot and we will be riding polar bears throwing axes at fish, so look out!

Now you’re starting to get to know Loda.

"If there ever was a Hall of Fame in *DotA*, he would be placed on top of it," wrote Hendrik "chsn" De Backe for SK Gaming.

"If you do not know Loda, you do not know *DotA*," wrote Anubis on Bloodzone.net.

Below the smiling exterior is an unmistakable intelligence.

Adnan "Darthozzan" Dervisevic, the host of MOBA Weekly, played a quick game of word association.

When you think of Loda, what comes to mind?

"Shadow Fiend [a *DotA* hero whose play Loda revolutionized]. Selfish play. The greatest Swedish player of all time," said Darthozzan. “SK.*DotA*. Some of the most entertaining and skillful play that I’ve ever seen. Loda is a bit of a personal hero of mine.”

Loda’s rise to prominence began while he was still in high school in late 2006. His team JoY won the popular MYM Prime tournament, was promptly sponsored by MYM (Meet Your Makers, an enduring and important organization in the European esports industry) and then went on to win the year’s DreamHack event.

By 2007, Loda was an ascendant star. As the leader on Team_Team (T_T), he made a name for himself by concocting counter-intuitive strategies that would come to define the game for millions of players. In particular, the "spectacular global gank strategy" and his powerful Shadow Fiend play propelled him to legendary heights within the still growing scene.

"You never knew what to expect from the team," wrote chsn for SK Gaming.

"His abundant individual ability and the unique glamour of his play gave him the capability for quite a long time to carry his relatively mediocre teammates," wrote CtChocula on GosuGamers.net, “against MYM and VP, two star-studded teams.”

"He inspires me through gameplay," said Darthozzan. “Even though sometimes his teammates hate him, it looks awesome. He’s one of the reasons I started casting *DotA*. It’s hard to put into words but when I heard that Loda is coming back to *DotA* with *Dota 2* [in late 2011], I got all giddy. He has a way of utiziling heroes that is just special. The way he ganks [targets and destroys enemy heroes] is really dynamic and makes for very interesting gameplay. He always finds the weak spots.”

*DotA* has managed to inspire an intense fan base rarely matched. Players such as Loda and Vigoss boast hundreds of thousands of fans. Nations such as the Phillipines are fanatical about *DotA* to the point of having parties on the street after major matches. There are columnists doling out advice to Filipino women who have ‘lost’ their men to *DotA*, a phenomenon much like the *Quake*-widows of ten years prior.

As *Warcraft 3* faded quickly, *DotA* games spread much like wildfire, consuming and renewing Battle.net in the process. By 2009, *DotA* had inspired standalone commercial releases.  The following year, several more titles were released or were in development. The teams in charge of the new games’ creations included several prominent members of the *DotA* mod crew including Guinsoo (for Riot Games’ *League of Legends*) and IceFrog (for Valve’s *DotA 2*).

In a few years time, the *DotA* genre would become one of the most popular esports genres of all time.
