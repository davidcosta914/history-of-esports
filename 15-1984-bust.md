# Chapter 15 - The Bust (1984)

The greatest hit of the golden age of video games was 1981’s *Ms. Pac-Man*, a sped up version of the original game (*Pac-Man*) with extra mazes, smarter ghosts and a female protagonist. It became one of the best-selling games in arcade history and one of the biggest challenges for those gamers who wanted to compete.

Billy Mitchell’s 1985 high score of 230,020 was not broken for 11 years. Abdner Ashman set the latest record in 2006 at 933,580 according to Twin Galaxies.

Starting in 1982, the arcade business began to stagnate and then decline. Once more, interest in video games seemed to tail off.

The home console business was becoming crowded. Activision was formed when several designers at Atari left over compensation and credit issues, problems that were all too common in the growing industry. When Activision began to create games for Atari’s VCS, the ensuing court action and Activision victory led to the legitimization of third party publishing and can claim partial credit (but only partial, as first party publishers did more than their fair share) for the eventual flood of the market with games of notoriously poor quality. 

Activision themselves were unqualified successes, quickly becoming the fastest growing company in U.S. history. Poetically, Activision took that crown from their former bosses and rivals at Atari.

In fact, as the market flooded and sales slowed, some of the most critically successful games of the era were released. However, they seemed to be the exception to a growing trend. In response to the rapid growth of the video game industry over recent years, developers rushed to release as many products as possible to exploit the new source of profit. 

Many games were objectively terrible ideas from the start. 

"Purina created a game titled *Chase the Chuck Wagon*, a video-game version of a television commercial for Chuck Wagon dog food," wrote Steve Kent in The Ultimate History of Video Games. That is not exactly inspirational stuff.

"There were too many people with too many arcades and too many games that they owed too much money on," said Walter Day in the Frag documentary, “and everything went down the tubes in what was known as the 1984 bust.” 

Companies vastly overestimated sales and manufactured more units than they could sell. 

"Atari manufactured 12 million copies of *Pac-Man* [for the Atari 2600 console] even though the company’s research showed that less than 10 million people actually owned and used its 2600s," continued Kent.

The floodwaters rose as a dozen different consoles were released on the market at the time. Legendarily dismal games on the Atari 2600 soured gamers on new releases and squandered capital. Of particular note is *E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial*, a colossal creative and commercial failure, celebrated even today as a singularly magnificent bust.

The bloated industry had delusions of grandeur. Once the impending disaster was identified, grossly large licensing payments were made to bring arcade hits to home consoles ostensibly to save the day. Instead, millions of dollars in huge licensing were but another nail in the industry’s coffin.

Hundreds of millions of dollars and thousands of jobs were lost by individual companies as consumers simply stopped buying. Bankruptcies hit, companies were sold and the American video game industry was hamstrung and forever altered.

The industry that had enjoyed a meteoric rise to success was now deep in a crater of its own devastating design.
