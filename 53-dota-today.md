# Chapter 53 - DotA today (2009-2012)

Together, *Defense of the Ancients* (*DotA*), *League of Legends* (*LoL*) and *Heroes of Newerth* (*HoN*) form the core of the fastest growing genre in esports. Whether you call it MOBA (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena), ARTS (Action Real Time Strategy) or simply the *DotA* genre after its first massively popular game, the genre represents enormous growth. It regularly reaches audiences north of six figures through streams during major events and, recently, has gone higher still, well past 1 million.

As it has grown from and then overtook the *Warcraft 3* community, the *DotA* player base in Europe, Asia and America has reached enormous heights. The massive competitive audience is at least on par with any game in the world and, due to its huge popularity in China, represents a huge opportunity for the esports industry.

"It would take the industry a few years to recognize the power of this new genre," said the narrator in Machinma.com’s All Your History series, “but once they did the little mod became one of the hottest and most contentious movements in gaming history.”

*League of Legends* became the first independently produced MOBA title in October 2009, released as a free to play game in which payment was made for access to specific heroes. In 2010, BusinessInsider estimated *LoL* developers Riot Games took in anywhere from $25 to $30 million in profits thanks to the popularity of their game and business model. *Heroes of Newerth* would be forced to take the free to play tack by 2011, never reaching the popularity level of *LoL*.

*LoL*’s mechanics differ from *DotA*’s in several key ways.

"Every hero has additional skills and every hero can get a blink," explained Darthozzan. “You don’t lose gold when you die and  you don’t have the ability to deny creep so that the other team doesn’t get experience and gold. The last three items are what make people consider *LoL* to have a lower skill cap than *DotA* in similar ways that people consider *SC2 *a lower skill cap game than *Brood War*. [There is] less room for your mechanics to shine.”

*League of Legend*’s esports success has been attributed to various factors. 

In contrast to *DotA*, which required the purchase and installation of *Warcraft 3* as well as the finding, downloading and installation of the mod itself, *LoL* was free-to-play after a simple download from the main website. The player base has surpassed 35 million accounts due in no small part to the ease of play.

Secondly, the developers themselves (Riot Games) have pushed esports in a way that no developers had in the past. In addition to investing greatly in areas like competitive infrastructure, organized competition and prize pools, the company consistently embeds competitive video streams directly into the game client itself. This allows every single player to be turned onto competitive gaming, driving the viewership up and pushing the competitions themselves (such as MLG) to continue to feature *LoL*. This, of course, attracts more players. Riot’s hope is that the cycle continuously repeats itself.

*DotA 2*’s business model is yet to be determined as of this writing.

On the one hand, the free-to-play model has proven financially successful for Riot Games, earning them upwards of $25 million in revenue in 2010, a significant accomplishment for a new company. There is a large player base currently pumping tens of millions of dollars into the company.

However, many of the *DotA* faithful are vocally pushing for a traditional one time fee for the sequel. Although the game would be more expensive up front, the prospect of hiding heroes behind a pay wall is perceived as harmful to the competitive scene. This line of thinking posits that in a fair competition, all players have immediate access to all potential tools without having to pay for them (as in *LoL*) or play for them (as in MMORPG-style games). 

A one time fee is the only way to keep a balanced playing field for all involved. Community figures as prominent as Toby "TobiWan" Dawson and Adnan "Darthozzan" Dervisevic have made predictions that *DotA 2* will have the one time fee. A quick glance at the *DotA 2 *community (the game is in beta as of this writing) shows that most community members seem in favor of the one time fee.

As *DotA 2* approaches, the expectations are extremely high. Players, teams and sponsors from around the genre are, to some extent, converging on this one title. 

As the new esport grows legs, the movements within the industry provide an illuminating lesson on the ins and outs of the business.

Loda, the *DotA 1* legend, spoke to ESFIWorld’s Philip "Nazroth" Hubner about how he is approaching *DotA 2* with his team xP (Experience).

"We have been contacted by pretty good names and pretty big sponsors but we decided from the start that we wouldn’t jump into some sponsorship," said Loda. “They want a big name that they can show and then we get some results and blah blah blah. We want a real sponsor that wants to invest time into the team and go for something more long term. I already have a lot of offers because - well, it’s arrogant to say it maybe - but just because I’m Loda and I have a big name and it gives good exposure. But still, we’re going to wait for a good offer and wait for a sponsor we feel good with, someone we can work with and feel at ease with.”

Loda continued to speak about major teams such as Mousesports and Fnatic that had already picked up major *DotA 2* teams while the game was still in beta.

The organizations, he explained, are taking chances on unproven teams, teams that are simply not yet as good as their *DotA 1* counterparts. However, they must take these chances because if they don’t pick up up a *DotA 2* team in time, they will be on the outside looking in for what is sure to be one of the biggest esports in 2012.

The organizations are being smart in the face of uncertainty, Loda continued, but some of the players are being had.

"If you look at how cheap it is for sponsors to pick up a team right now for *DotA 2*," said Nazroth, “it’s not like in *Counter-Strike *where most big teams have salaries. I suppose most *DotA 2* teams don’t have salaries. [Some] sponsors only really pay with gear and tshirts.”

"I don’t think teams realize, it’s so stupid to sign a dumb sponsorship [with no long term value]," said Loda. “They [sponsors] get a lot of exposure from any team that actually places in top 3 [in major tournaments] and that’s good PR for themselves. They then get investments from other companies. I just feel like a lot of teams, they are okay with just picking a name from the sponsor but they don’t really get anything. I think *DotA 2 *is going to be a really big game, you don’t want to sign a bad contract. A lot of these teams, they don’t take that seriously enough. Like I said, I’ve been contacted by a lot of sponsors. With most of them, I turn them down without speaking to them because I know they won’t offer anything real.”

In several respects, *DotA 2* already is a big esport.

Valve’s $1.6 million prize pool tournament dubbed The Invitational (then the biggest prize pool in esports history) took place in August 2011 at the GamesCom trade fair in Germany. It was the first public viewing of *DotA 2*. The tournament, which Ukranian team Natus Vincere won over the Chinese EHOME 3-1, shows that Valve is dedicated to pushing significant amounts of cash into esports as a major way to promote their game.

"I think there are a lot of opportunities for game developers to provide better platforms for esports," aid Gabe Newell, Valve’s managing director, in an interview with WellPlayed.org. “I also think that professional play is a form of content authoring, and that it needs to be integrated into an overall notion of user generated content. Since this is a challenge that is already being taken on by game developers, I think it’s good news for esports fans and competitors. In other words I think there are a bunch of structural changes that are occurring in game design and game services that will, intentionally or not, benefit esports.”

Already, *DotA 2* as an esport has helped influence the overall game.

"Running The International was an eye-opening experience for us both on the production side and the spectating side," said Newell to WellPlayed. “We see a lot of immediate work we have done and are going to do to help support esports. This will over time get migrated into Steamworks for other developers to take advantage of if it makes sense for their products.”

The International was an overwhelming success. The tournament boasts the largest number of concurrent viewers in esports history with over 1.5 million people watching the opening rounds according to Valve. Many of the viewers were Chinese, a testament to the enduring popularity of the *DotA* name in China.

The potential success of *DotA 2* stands as one of the greatest questions in esports in 2012.
