# Chapter 41 - The esports divide (2005)Throughout the esports world, major events have always tended to use multiple and diverse titles. WCG, ESWC, MLG and CPL have sported competitions for numerous titles from the FPS, RTS and MOBA genres. It is a common sight to see WarCraft 3 and Counter-Strike played at the same event.Several notable attempts have been made to bring the fighting game community into “traditional esports leagues” (as they call them) but each attempt has been met with failure to some extent.Esports leagues such as WCG, MLG and CGS have alienated fighting fans by choosing less-than-competitive titles (for instance, WCG 2005 opting for Dead or Alive 4, a game with little competitive following at the time, instead of Marvel vs. Capcom 2, one of the most important fighting games of the era) or, in the case of MLG, not giving fighting games their due floor space and credit. Additionally, mainstream events such as DreamHack are targets of criticism because they have not engaged the fighting community and sought feedback to improve themselves and their product.Companies such as Capcom (publisher of a plethora of fighters, most notably Street Fighter) have actively withheld licensing rights from what the fighting game community calls “traditional esports leagues”.In 2011, MLG CEO Sundance DiGiovanni publically called the relationship between his company and Capcom “poisoned.” The exact reasons behind the cold relationship remain unknown. Is it the less than perfect past of esports organizations working with fighting games? Or is it indicative of the poor, passive and at points nonexistent support Capcom has given its competitive scene?How much of it is due to Shoryuken and Evo, the fighting game’s biggest event, actively editorializing against the spread of fighting games into esports events? The Cannon brothers (who run Shoryuken and Evo) have actively editorialized and stand, potentially, to lose if other events made an entrance into the scene.A figure in the fighting game community who wishes to remain anonymous explained the rift this way.“In 2005, MLG and Evo collaborated. It went sour. The fighting game community was shoved off the side, roped in and given little floor space. Only, the fighting games had way higher numbers than the rest of the event as a whole. And then the MLG people bitched about the FGC being loud and hype. It seems like a long time ago but there has been nothing from MLG to try to make amends as far as I know. They just keep on doing what they are doing and not giving a fuck.“For instance, in 2011, there were only two stops on the MLG tour that didn’t coincide with a fighting game major [event]. You are talking about some big events [including Evo itself,] another fuck you from MLG to the Evo staff.“The one who fucks it up with Capcom is actually Seth [Killian], Capcom’s community manager. He’s been a part of the behind the scenes at Evo before it was named Evo. So while he can’t directly make the call where you don’t sell rights, he can influence the people who can. That’s also the reason none of the fighting game majors get sued for streaming licensed content.”There is a vocal and somewhat contentious divide between the esports world and the fighting game community. The term esports is itself shunned by many members of the FGC because it comes across as false and childish to many to compare competitive gaming to professional sports.“So here is my fundamental problem with the term eSports,” wrote Inkblot in a Shoryuken editorial. “It immediately invites an unnecessary comparison to real sports. It puts people on the defensive. The author [of a piece criticizing the term esports] is not objecting to the idea of playing games competitively, or that lots of people will watch it as a form of entertainment. She objects to calling it a sport, in the same way that many people don’t think bowling or chess is a sport.  It’s easy to say that people like this are just uneducated and don’t get it, but the reality is that this whole esports concept still does not have mainstream support, even among gamers.”The term esports has always been subject to debate in every community because of the implications and presumptions it makes. However, a better name has never been found. ‘Competitive gaming’ is a relative mouthful and ‘professional gaming’ is too exclusive. Esports has its issues but quickly and concisely gets the broad idea of the thing across. For those reasons, it is marketing gold far more than its more wordy counterparts.That attitude tends to invite criticism because communicability is valued more highly than authenticity.How we name ourselves is more than a game of trivial semantics, it is a matter of presenting ourselves in a positive way to the world. This is a continuing and evolving discussion between varying corners of the competitive gaming world.Members of the FGC such as Inkblot see the esports world as modeling itself after professional sports to the point where competitive gaming can become an impersonal, money-driven pursuit that can potentially suck the soul out of playing games for fun and community.The word esport is seen by much of the fighting game world as “an incredibly sad, self-denying, misguiding attempt to borrow legitimacy from the world of traditional sports,” wrote Ultradavid (David Graham), a fighting game community commentator.The fighting game community prides themselves immensely on their arcade past, a past (and to a some significant extent, a present) that was built on playing and interacting with others face to face and becoming immersed in the community in that way. The fighting game community is self-defined by this past from the way the players act (loud, as befits an arcade) to the way they train (in person, as online play is simply not competitive due to lag). Almost all other competitive games were built online first and so have a fundamental difference in their past and culture.The fighting game community is afraid of selling out their ideals. They see traditional esports as markedly different from themselves. They see the world of esports as much more of a commercial pursuit whereas they feel they are much more of a community.“The danger in calling Street Fighter an eSport,” continued Inkblot, “is that we lose the ability to talk about what the fighting game scene is really about, using competitive gaming to build relationships with real people, and instead get rolled up into the whole eSports messaging about games as professional sports.  This bears repeating: the fighting game scene has thrived because of the heart and passion of gamers and because of the ways in which we are exactly not like a pro sports league. Calling Street Fighter an eSport betrays our very identity.”“The last demographic difference [between fighting games and other esports] is size,” wrote Ultradavid. “Each of the esports communities is larger than the FGC. Battle.net has hundreds of thousands of people on it at any one time. Millions of people play console shooters every day. There are still tens of thousands of people playing Counter-Strike every day. We can’t compete with those numbers.“Why the difference? I don’t know that I can really get into all the reasons that FPS, RTS, and now MOBA games have been more popular than fighting games. I don’t really know them. But suffice to say, they have been. They sell better and they never went through anything like our Dead Era. From 2001 to 2008, there were literally no tournament viable 2D fighting games released without an import-only restriction. As you might imagine, that put a pretty severe constraint on how much we could grow. Even in 2004 after our famous Daigo Parry moment, only so many people were gonna be inspired enough to pick up the five year old Street Fighter III: Third Strike. StarCraft went a decade without a true sequel, but WarCraft 3 came out in the middle and Blizzard never stopped supporting either one.”The fighting game community remains wary of overtly profit-driven attempts to grow their game. They often view attempts by teams, organizations and companies to get involved in their scene as artificial, as astroturf versus their grassroots. When Evil Geniuses began to outright sponsor players such as Justin Wong, the move was met with skepticism. When Complexity partnered with fighting game natives Cross Counter (including Gootecks and Mike Ross), the deal was met much more positively.“Historically, many players felt that joining teams and other organizations was ‘selling out’”, said Complexity owner Jason Lake, “instead of advancing their career and gaining much needed exposure and financial support. That is beginning to change in a big way.”The future of the fighting game community may continue along its separate path but increasing influence from “traditional esports” (games like StarCraft and Counter-Strike) suggests that overlap is inevitable.As of late 2011, major fighting games regularly boast streams with 30,000 viewers. Weekly tournaments attract around 7,000 viewers.While the exact future of fighting games continues to be debated, its current trajectory seems beyond debate.
