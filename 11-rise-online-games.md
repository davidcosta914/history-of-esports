# Chapter 11 - Rise of Online Gaming (1970s, 1980s)As the arcades, hand held games and home consoles caught fire and the gaze of the public in the 1970s, the computer - the machine on which video games were born - advanced steadily if quietly.The internet, the raison d’etre of modern competitive gaming, has been a computer gaming mainstay for decades.The roots of the internet extend back into the Cold War world of the 1950s. After the USSR launched Sputnik, the United States responded in several major ways. In addition to the launching of the space race, the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA, later renamed DARPA after adding Defense to the name), an arm of the US military, worked with MIT to network computers in the interest of national defense. This was ARPAnet.In the 1960s, the PLATO network (Programmed Logic for Automated Teaching Operations) was launched to aid educators. By the 1970s, games such as the FPS Spasim were using the network for its own purposes.The game MUD (Multi User Dungeon) came into the world in 1978 in Essex University in England. From the original game, an eponymous genre emerged.As defined by Wikipedia, a MUD game “is a multiplayer real-time virtual world described primarily in text. MUDs combine elements of role-playing games, hack and slash, player versus player, interactive fiction and online chat.”The game was connected by the school to ARPAnet in 1980, marking a milestone in online gaming and paving the way for massively multiplayer online role-playing games or MMORPGs.1977 saw the release of the Apple II, the Commodore PET and the TRS-80. These three products kick started the era of personal computing, ending the previous era in which computers were found almost exclusively in academia, industry or government. As the public adopted personal computing with some zeal, they immediately agreed upon at least one use for the new machine in their homes: gaming.With the personal computer arriving in homes in droves, the domain of game creation was expanded hugely. No longer was the world of video game creation the exclusive domain of elite schools such as MIT or of private industry. Game design took place in living rooms and basements now. Clever computer-heads were designing games for the Apple II in their rooms instead of doing their high school geometry homework. With will and wit, regular people could become virtual gods, creating great works whose influence can be strongly felt today.As Tristan Donovan wrote in Replay, “Few of them had any idea they were building an industry.”While a great number started with relatively modest means and profound business naivete, many of these passionate designers would become legends in the video game world. Of course, some would become quite rich while they were at it.The 1980s would see the internet and its games advance further down the road toward modernity.Maze War, the FPS created at NASA’s Ames Research Center, was advancing peer-to-peer gaming.Bulletin Board System (BBS) gaming was on the rise in 1984. Seminal games such as Trade Wars 2002 allowed players from around the world to dial up and log in to the host for a limited number of turns in order to advance themselves toward goals, whether that be galactic dominance or slaying a dragon.PCWorld.com named Trade Wars 2002 the number ten best PC game of all time, saying, “For a surprising number of people, Trade Wars 2002 is the greatest PC game they’ve never heard of.”The magazine continues on to trace a direct lineage to MMO darling EVE Online, saying that it is a modern 3D version of Trade Wars.Also in 1984, the MAD game (Multi Access Dungeon, in fact a MUD itself) was accessible to anyone with a connection to BITNET, a cooperative network formed by Yale University and the City University of New York in the USA.In 1984, Time Magazine named the personal computer the “Machine of the Year”, replacing the man of the year and marking the ascent of the PC.It would not be until the 1990s that the public finally adopted online gaming wholeheartedly. This took place thanks to games such as Doom, Quake and Neverwinter Nights.The games from the 70s and 80s that preceded those legendary titles are often forgotten but the visionaries who created them laid the foundation for some of the most important technological advancements of our era both inside games and out.
