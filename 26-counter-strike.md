# Chapter 26 - Counter-Strike (1999)

The CPL’s initial rise happened thanks to franchises such as *Quake* and other deathmatch competitions. By 1999, a new game was under development that would take the reins as the premiere esport in the Western world. This game was *Counter-Strike*.

"*Counter-Strike* was the brain child and passion project of [Canadian game developer and modder] Minh ‘Gooseman’ Le," wrote Duncan "Thorin" Shields, an esports journalist and editor-in-chief at SK Gaming, “coming out of his previous project, *Action Quake 2*, and spilling over into the *Half-Life* engine thanks to [*Half-Life* creators] Valve releasing their Software Development Kit. He [Gooseman] continued work on *Counter-Strike* throughout the betas [from March 1999 to November 2000] and changed things as the game progressed.”

A deathmatch game like *Quake* pitted one player against another in a fast paced shoot ‘em up that was relatively easy to follow even if it did possess considerable depth and took significant skill to play at a high level.

*Counter-Strike* takes a different tack. The game is a methodical and tactical team-based shooter. One team of five players (the terrorists) has to work in concert to accomplish goals (such as killing the five counter-terrorists or detonating a bomb at one of two valuable targets) while avoiding being killed or stonewalled themselves.

*Half-Life*’s hugely popular modification scene (including rightly revered titles such as *Team Fortress Classic* and *Day of Defeat*) saw its peak in *Counter-Strike*. From the moment information about the game began spreading in early March 1999 to the beginning of the beta in June ‘99, from the multiple feels and forms the game took throughout that year and a half of beta until the release of [retail version] 1.0 under Valve’s ownership in November 2000, the game experienced a meteoric rise in popularity. 

In writing about the history of *Counter-Strike* and, specifically, Valve Software’s stewardship of the franchise, Thorin continues:

>Amongst players who experienced the game competitively during the betas many would argue over which beta was the best competitive vehicle for *Counter-Strike*, according to personal preferences and idiosyncrasies but few would not agree that the best competitive *Counter-Strike* version was one of the betas. From the retail era, when Valve stepped in, onwards the game became more and more watered down and limited in terms of skill curve, skill ceiling and competitive variety.

As symptoms of Valve’s mismanagement, Thorin cites the removal of the ability to quick-walk, the more limited spray control of the rifles, the removal of the quick-switch on the AWP, the addition of slowdown on consecutive jumps, the changes to Inferno (a popular map) and the ability to fire pistols in the air with accuracy.

Although nostalgia for the faster, more difficult beta versions is strong among those who experienced it, the game’s popularity kept rising as Valve took ownership and development of the game into their own hands.

A month after the retail version was released, the CPL held its first *Counter-Strike* event in December 2000 in Cologne, Germany thanks in large part to the vision of Frank Nuccio, founder of Domain of Games (which would later become the Cyberathlete Amateur League or CAL, the CPL’s immensely popular online counterpart). 

Initially, *Counter-Strike* was set to be little more than a hidden sideshow during that event. However, once the excited screaming and yelling of the *CS* players swept into the *Quake* area, curious spectators came to watch. What they saw was an exciting team sport being born before their eyes. Players were alive, screaming commands and intelligence at each other over a growing crowd. The *Quake* kids were hooked.

Two weeks later at the CPL Winter 2000 Championships in Dallas, one of two premiere CPL events that year, the first CPL *Counter-Strike* world champions were crowned. Sweden’s Team 9, named for the famous Stockholm esports cafe and with a team including the revered player Tommy "Potti" Ingemarsson, took home the prize. 

The next event in April 2001 saw the American team X3 take gold. X3 sported some of the most important names in American *Counter-Strike* history in Ksharp, Bullseye, Moto and Rambo. These four competitors would later play a central role in the most important American esports franchise of the early aughts, Team 3D.

By the Winter 2001 CPL event (where *CS* had by then aged to the widely popular version 1.3), a growing five figure prize pool and a star studded cast of players brought *Counter-Strike* into the spotlight in a big way.

GotFrag founder Trevor "Midway" Schmidt called the 2001 championship match was called the obvious greatest *Counter-Strike* match of all time. It is a clash in need of no build up or hype, he said, it is "the beginning of professional *Counter-Strike*."

The American team X3 (still consisting of first ballot hall of fame players such as Ksharp, Rambo and Bullseye) faced off against the Swedish Ninjas in Pyjamas, NiP (a team with legendary names such as Potti, HeatoN, vesslan, ahl and more).

"Everyone who was there understood that *CS* had changed forever after the match took place," wrote Schmidt for GotFrag. “No longer was *CS* [the] second game behind *Quake*. No longer was *CS* a slow game that no one could understand or follow. *CS *had arrived.”

Aside from the exciting play of both teams, one of the catalysts toward greatness for this match was *Half-Life* TV (HLTV). Released just a few months prior, HLTV allowed for unprecedented spectator abilities. Spectators and commentators could view matches from absolutely any angle, including from a player’s first person point of view or from an arbitrary point on the map, moving freely at will.

A complex 5v5 game, *Counter-Strike* benefited immensely from the advent of this tool, unprecedented in spectator sports. Spectators were now able to follow the action more closely and accurately than ever before. In response, they cheered with greater ferocity and in greater numbers than ever before. The growing audience was on the edge of their seats for every frag during the championship match.

At the end of a back and forth match that firmly established the stars of several players (most notably Ksharp on the strength of his AWP play and HeatoN on his AK-47 prowess), the Swedes took the nail-biter championship match in overtime.

The Swede Emil "HeatoN" Christenson was *Counter-Strike*’s first great superstar, known affectionately then and now as "the one and only".

"The original *Counter-Strike* wunderkind HeatoN showed up on the scene as this young guy with amazing spray," wrote Duncan "Thorin" Shieldsin 2009. “Before the switch to 1.5 perhaps nobody ever had as intuitive an understanding of the rifle spray in *CS* as HeatoN did and he used that talent to help drive his teams to all the CPL titles on his era, nearly. Nine CPLs and a WCG gold medal is a haul which will never be matched in merit but by a mere handful of other greats in *CS*.”

HeatoN’s popularity also benefited from a CPL rivalry with the UK team 4Kings.

"His [HeatoN’s] famous video was published [and became extremely popular]," wrote Midway. “They [NiP] hated 4Kings and didn’t like that 4Kings went to CPL and they weren’t able to go.  So when HeatoN tore up 4Kings in a big semifinals match, NiP put together a video of it.  It was one of the first highlight videos and it make HeatoN look like a god, especially with an AK he used in most of it.”

While HeatoN’s spectacular aim was easy for fans to get excited about, the prodigal Swede did not consider himself the best player in the world. NiP’s Potti, who was simply smarter and far ahead of everyone, was obviously the best player in the world at the time according to HeatoN. HeatoN had thought so since the 1999 beta when he first spotted Potti in a public server and was sure Potti was a cheating scumbag.

Potti was the game’s original mind reader and a 1v1 (and 1v2) ace.

"We played X3 in the first CPL finals in 2001, he knew that the big dog was the AWPer on the X3 team," said HeatoN in an interview with Thorin in 2011. “He [Potti] knew where the X3 AWPer [Ksharp] was standing all the time because Ksharp had three positions. So Potti prefired him [shooting at him prior to any sight] and killed him for four rounds in a row.

"Potti was such a smart player. He didn’t have the best aim but he was so smart, it was crazy. He had such a mind for the game."

NiP would go on to win three CPLs and a DreamHack among other tournaments. HeatoN would go on to say it was the most dominant team he’d ever played on.

Aside from its immediate impact catalyzing the fan base, the NiP/X3 match has immense importance in posterity. The two teams included the cores of what would eventually become two of the most important *Counter-Strike* organizations of all time.

One of them, SK, would go on to become one of the most important esports organizations of all time period.

Schroet Kommando (SK Gaming) was founded in Germany in 1997 as a *Quake* team. Although the multi-game organization already had a German *Counter-Strike* squad in 2001, it was the team’s signing of the Swedish NiP players just a few months after their victory over X3 that brought the organization to its competitive apex. 

The marriage happened out of necessity from both sides. Much maligned manager G3X burdened NiP with poor leadership by failing to deliver on sponsors and funds, said HeatoN. Fund issues were so prevalent with NiP players that on the morning of a  CPL championship grand final match, the boys didn’t have enough money for breakfast.

SK, meanwhile, was fielding a mediocre Scandinavian squad at the time and looking to improve. Working high up at SK, Andreas "bds" Thorstensson was a personal friend of many of the NiP players. He saw the opportunity, pulled the strings and made the marriage happen.

SK.swe, as the team became known, would go on to win seven CPL gold medals from 2002 to 2005 (adding to the three they had won as NiP).

One of the team’s chief advantages was preparedness. More than any of their competitors, SK.swe invested a significant chunk of time into deep preparedness. The team printed out details maps and playbooks, drawing out their opponent’s past plays and habits. SK committed these to memory. What is now common practice was then a revelatory move. SK often knew the opposition better than the opposition knew themselves.

Moreover, SK knew each other. Strong social bonds were forged outside of the game. Potti and HeatoN became housemates and close friends. These strong friendships manifested themselves in game in unmatched chemistry. Each player knew his teammates well enough to know how he’d react to a specific situation. That sort of personal connection is invaluable.

One of the most celebrated *Counter-Strike* minds of all time, dubbed the new Norwegian wunderkind Ola "elemeNt" Moum, joined the team in 2003 and led SK to victories in two CPL events as well as a WCG championship through 2004. He pushed SK.swe from simply one of the best teams in the world to the absolute dominant number one.

"Nobody had a chance [against SK ‘03]," said elemeNt in an interview with SK-Gaming.com in 2011. 

"If there ever was a prodigy in *CS*, elemeNt was it," wrote Thorin.

elemeNt’s esports career is one of the stranger stories in all of esports. Beginning his ascent in 2002 as a young 16-year-old star, Moum would grow and develop what was the greatest game sense in *Counter-Strike* history. He would eclipse and eventually lead stars and former world number one players such as Potti and HeatoN to several world championships.

elemeNt’s most valuable talent was unique, abstract and powerful. At his peak, he was a quasi-psychic presence possessing an uncanny ability to read the opposing team exactly. Simple. 

Although Moum lacked the elite aim that a young HeatoN had boasted, the Norwegian seemed to see ten moves ahead on both sides before his opponents had made a single decision. His aim was more than good enough to win with an advantage like that.

With his notorious game sense, Moum was able to feed picture perfect reads of the opposition to his teammates. The in-game leader would use Moum’s insight to quickly craft an intelligent plan for their team and, much more often than not, the result was success and prize money.

"*CS* always felt very natural to me," said elemeNt in the 2011 SK interview. “Later in life, I learned that this is what you consider talent, when you don’t really have to make an effort to be good at something. To me, I always knew where people was gonna come. I didn’t have to think very hard or anything like this. It would just come natural to me.”

The game came easily to elemeNt. However, despite his gifts, Moum came to be seen by the public as near anti-social, emotionally and financially manipulative, a young man prone to emotional extremes, conflict and impatience to the nth degree. In truth, the fact that the game came so easily to elemeNt eventually served to hurt him.

Moum became known as a clan hopper, a player who gave no loyalty to any particular team or teammate, moving along as soon as he felt the urge to do so and leaving with no apologies as he said he was simply doing his own thing. His natural talent for *Counter-Strike* injected him with supreme confidence that would time and again lead him to leave a successful team for a much more challenging situation.

"I don’t know why it became like that," said elemeNt to Thorin. “Most people would be happy with just winning and keep it like that. But I found it a lot more exciting to have new goals, new challenges. You have to push yourself and set new goals. That’s what I did. Maybe too much.”

As much as new money would pull him to a new team, it was often conflict with teammates would spur him to leave.

SK Gaming was elemeNt’s sixth team in two years, a monumentally high number for a player considered the best in the world by a comfortable margin at that point. 

"I’d say elemeNt was a great skilled player and had the faith of his teammates," said Midway. “He had a good feel for the game.  I’m not sure he was ‘the next huge prodigy’.  He was the center of a really amazing team with Spawn and others.  He really carried the Norwegian CS scene and got a lot of added interest because of that.”

Although his stay with SK was rather impressive in its dominance, Moum became the first gamer to have his contract purchased when Team NoA bought him from SK Gaming, a move that came at his own urging. The move has been compared to the Houston Oilers trading away Wayne Gretzky only hours after winning a fourth Stanley Cup championship. SK was the greatest team of all time at that point and they were still winning convincingly. elemeNt could not replace them.  Likewise, the team could never replace elemeNt as no player in the world could rival his singularly powerful skill set. 

elemeNt’s move to NoA had no one immediately doubting his persevering talent as that team won the CPL Winter 2004 world championship. Angel Munoz and Trevor Schmidt have called 2004 the apex of the CPL.

On NoA, elemeNt’s reign as a top player continued but his reputation began to sink.

Gary "Seige" Sanchez, the general manager of NoA, is said to have stolen money from his players.

"Sanchez stole Jørgen "XeqtR" Johannessen (the in-game leader)’s cut of NoA’s prize money from winter CPL ($30,000) and all of the player’s (save Moum’s) WEG1 [World Esports Games] money ($50,000)," wrote Jonas Alsaker Vikan for GotFrag. “There were also months of unpaid salaries for several of them. Moum was rumored to enjoy that financial benefit as well but he has always steadily maintained that he never received a dime that he had not rightfully won himself.”

XeqtR and elemeNt’s relationship can be compared to Shaquille O’Neal and Kobe Bryant’s tumultuous but successful time on the Los Angeles Lakers. 

The two players complemented each other beautifully. Moum would read the opposition with characteristic clairvoyance and then feed the insight to XeqtR. XeqtR, an old school talent and one of the founding fathers of Norwegian *Counter-Strike*, would quickly formulate a killer strategy that would earn the team yet another win.

However, tension grew. elemeNt’s rash, self-satisfied new talent had long created tension with the older and more established XeqtR, from their 2003 days on eoLithic (eoL, a top Norwegian team) to their reuniting on NoA. In fact, when XeqtR signed with eoL in 2002, he made it a condition that elemeNt would have to be kicked off the team.

Siege, the much-maligned manager of NoA (who was living with elemeNt and Method in California at the time), was able to take prize money from his players due to the way tournaments such as the CPL did business. Back then, the manager completed all of the relevant paper work and was easily able to put only his name as the recipient of the prize money. It was not a system designed to protect players.

During this time, Siege began to lose weight rapidly. It was the sort of sudden weight loss that left skin hanging off his body, the sort of weight loss sometimes seen as a result of crystal meth abuse. In this era, before more modern Adderall abuse, it was drugs such as crystal meth that allowed gamers to stay up for days at a time (at, for instance, a CPL) and play at their best. Rumors spread of drug abuse connected to the prize money theft. Those rumors persist to this day among prominent members of the industry and are discussed with relative certainty.

Both Method (whose name seems to call attention to the crystal meth rumors) and elemeNt (whose noticeably poor appearance at the time did nothing to dispel the talk) were rumored to use the drug as well.

"Gary Sanchez and elemeNt took advantage of the rest of their team and took the money from some of their events," said Midway, “and we [Gotfrag] went after them. I think elemeNt still hates me to this day.”

elemeNt’s clan hopping became increasingly erratic from there, including a brief and troubled stint on the always interesting team Made in Brazil. Despite the fact that Moum spoke no Portuguese and had never participated in the Latin American scene, he took to the new team as a challenge to alleviate boredom, one of several signs to many of either his boyish naivete or carelessness. When he was unable to produce a miracle and good results, elemeNt simply took an extended vacation instead of practicing with the team and was therefore promptly released. He now calls the adventure stupid and pointless.

"Love him or hate him, the truth is that Ola Moum was without a doubt one of the most influential, but also controversial, players of the last decade," wrote Miraa for HLTV.org. “A lot can be said about him, his temperament, or the fact he switched teams more often than some change underwear, but his contribution to the tactical game that *Counter-Strike* has become is undeniable.”

"I think elemeNt was young and impressionable," wrote Midway. “He also in my opinion was very selfish. He fell in with the wrong crowd and quickly jumped onto the bandwagon of what everyone else wanted to do, whether that was drugs or partying. With that said, he was an amazing Counter-Strike player and that came from his ability to read the game and know what was going to happen before it did. He earned the trust of his teammates because of that ability.”

Although he stayed relevant and sought after for several more years, it was elemeNt’s time with SK that added the most weight to his legend.

SK’s reign during the 2000s was one of the most dominant, spectacular and lucrative in all of esports history. The SK organization became one of the most important in the entire industry and the single highest mark for the Western world for several key years. Their business model served as an inspiration throughout the industry. SK-Gaming.com was, for a significant time, one of the most important esports news sites in the West. SK Insider was the first successful attempt to offer premium content (such as demos, conversations with professionals, etc) to fans. SK was the first Western FPS team to contract players.

NiP’s American counterparts, X3, would eventually go on to form Team 3D.

Team 3D (standing for Desire, Discipline and Dedication) began when Craig Levine, a then unknown 18 year old New Yorker working at at a Manhattan web cafe (called web2zone), was given the task by a superior to create an American *Counter-Strike* team to compete in the World Cyber Games.

Although the beginning of 3D was tumultuous (a promised sponsorship from WCG sponsor and organizer Samsung fell through), 3D was the self-proclaimed first professional American esports squad.

On the strength of his promised but ultimately empty sponsorships, Levine was able to convince Kyle "Ksharp" Miller and the core of the X3 team to join him at 3D. 

"Ksharp was extremely gifted [with] aim and [his] ability to react to the game," said Midway. 

His star began its rapid ascent in that CPL championship against NiP.

"He was in a great position [that game] playing above ladder/support of ramp on de_nuke," continued Midway. “Porter (the unremembered weak link of X3) played ramp so NiP constantly rushed or attached ramp over and over.  That left Ksharp in a position to basically see all the action.  That match was the first time over 30,000 [people] were watching on HLTV.  Because of that he put up massive numbers and had the focus of the community.  I’m not taking anything away from him but he was in the right place at the right time to launch his career.”

While sponsorship issues continued and Levine bankrolled 3D on his personal credit card for months, the team began winning major tournaments (including a WCG qualifier and a $10,000 web2zone tournament) and picking up momentum.

The team took the most important step forward when they won the CPL Winter 2002 world championships. Although the beginning of the tournament consisted of them beating mostly middling American squads, the tail end of the tournament saw 3D defeat SK.swe and then Game OnLine (GoL, elemeNt’s squad at the time), one of the most impressive and cocky European teams in the scene. With innovative and gutsy play (including what is credited as the birth of the now standard "save round"), The American team claimed the $30,000 first prize and much more besides.

The climactic championship match carried major implications for an American scene that had played second fiddle to Europe for quite some time. The 2002 event was the first time the Americans had won a CPL that major Swedish teams attended. 

After struggling for over eight months, 3D’s exciting CPL win was the perfect storm for the team. Since X3’s loss to NiP in 2001, the CPL’s biggest draw had been *Counter-Strike* by a mile. The game had grown the live event by hundreds and thousands of spectators from what had been just a couple of hundred with *Quake*. The online streaming and reporting of the CPL was becoming hugely popular on websites like GotFrag.com for the same reasons. The international rivalry between an underdog America and a dominant Europe sparked a passion and fame for 3D that had never been seen before.

At the exact moment of that spark, Craig Levine met personally with sponsors CompUSA and NVIDIA and was able to secure player and management salaries, travel expenses and equipment, a first for an American team. At a moment when no other American team could hope to call itself professional, Team 3D at long last lived up to their own billing.

By the early 2000s, *Counter-Strike* was one of the most popular multiplayer games in the world. At peak times, over 90,000 people were playing. Millions played in any given month, pouring billions of minutes into the game. 

By 2002, comparisons between esports leagues such as CPL and the beginnings of traditional sports leagues such as the NFL and MLG were repeated with increasing frequency.

"In many respects, Munoz’s CPL resembled the early days of Major League Baseball," wrote King and Borland in Dungeons and Dreamers. “Until 1845, baseball, too, was wholly recreational, played by rich men who made their games the centerpiece of all-day social activities. Invitations were sent. Food and drink were served. Most importantly, there were no official ground rules for the game. Instead, the players used an honor code, agreeing upon rules the day of the game, and then refereeing themselves. That changed with the introduction of 20 rules, the framework for today’s national pastime, which allowed teams from the New York area to begin competing against each other in loosely organized leagues. The standardization, meant to foster games between the upper class, opened the doors for blue-collar teams. Anyone who couple gamer eight players - this was before a shortstop was added - could now play and 10 years after the introduction of the ‘Knickerbocker rules,’ teams with players from all social castes were going head to head.”

The book goes on to describe the subsequent spread of baseball across the United States. Moneyed interested, corporations took notice of the captivated crowds. Within a few decades, hundreds of teams played in numerous leagues as money was pumped into the game. The leagues eventually became one and baseball became a multibillion dollar behemoth through ticket sales, television revenue and merchandising.

Many in esports hoped and hope to make an analogous jump.

In late 2002, another major institution was born. Coming straight from leading the news team at Domain of Games to prominence, Trevor "Midway" Schmidt and roughly a dozen other writers, designers and contributors founded GotFrag.com, a site that would become the undisputed global leader of *Counter-Strike* coverage and the most important esports website in the Western world.

At a time when the number of full-time esports journalists may have numbered as little as two in the entire world (Midway himself and the coverage writer for ShackES.com at the time), Midway launched an ambitious effort to create a central media hub for *Counter-Strike* reminiscent of ESPN, the American sports cable network. It would take almost four years for GotFrag to become profitable.

Midway and his team’s renown from Domain of Games, the immediately excellent work done on GotFrag and the lack of serious journalistic rivals led GotFrag to quickly rise to the top of the esports food chain. GotFrag’s written features, on-site event coverage, statistical database, vibrant (if abrasive) community and unparalleled access to important organizations were but a few of the ingredients in its success.

Esports journalism was in its embryonic state at this point. GotFrag, though instantly successful, was seen as "a fly buzzing around his [Angel’s] head" according to Midway. It was not uncommon for the operation to come into conflict with the CPL founder over perceived critical coverage to the point where Midway was personally banned from several CPL events by Angel.

In a 2011 interview, Midway described Angel as "almost bipolar", one minute being “the craziest person in the room, literally the craziest guy in the room, and I don’t mean a small room, I mean the entire CPL with thousands of people. The next minute, he will be completely normal, you will have a very serious business conversation with him. Again, this guy knows business, he wouldn’t have gotten in the position he was, he wouldn’t have convinced all those sponsors, he wouldn’t have gotten Intel to spend millions of dollars on him if he didn’t have a good business head. He did. The problem was, the rest of him wasn’t all there. He would just go off.”

The irony of the situation is that in later years, Midway and GotFrag’s intimacy and many connections with CPL and Angel would prevent them from publishing articles critical of the CPL.

Led by organizations like SK Gaming and Team 3D, *Counter-Strike* forged a charismatic new esport more popular by far in the West than any that had come before. Websites such as GotFrag.com helped elevate esports journalism to new heights by providing high quality, multimedia coverage of major events. 

Esports has long been fertile ground for big ideas (Super Bowls, world tours, TV networks, feature films and more), albeit results vary wildly. The specifics of the attraction varies from person to person but most have at least one commonality. In esports, one person can make a significant impact.

"When I started gaming it was about building something," wrote Midway. “I wanted to be a part of ‘esports’ although honestly no one knew what that was at the time. My feeling was that one person could make a huge impact and that drew me to getting involved.  I started with RiTD then moved to DoG and CAL and later started GotFrag.  I learned quickly that I had the most impact in writing and promoting events so I focused on that and I found that writing about it was a whole new appeal.  Being able to give my opinion and create a passion for the game was an extremely rewarding and helped to share my love of eSports with everyone else.”

One of the keys to esports growth during this time was the emergence of streaming content.

ShoutCasting (a name derived from Nullsoft’s ShoutCast streaming software) began in esports in earnest in 1999 with the advent of Team Sportscast Network (TSN), a company dedicated to audio streaming competitive gaming such as *Quake*.

The success of such operations led to rivals and offshoots such as Inside the Game (iTg) where major esports personalities such as Marcus "djWHEAT" Graham gained prominence throughout the gaming world.

"I think anyone who saw the early days of TsN or HLTV broadcasts knew it would be huge," said Midway. “It would have been bigger if the money was there to support it. It’s only been in the last year [2011] that revenue was been there and that’s why it’s exploded. Broadcasting has been there in the past and the numbers have been there but it was a losing game.  Every person on your stream cost you money to support it and you couldn’t afford it. Now it’s the other way around. Advertisers will pay you for the number of people watching and the money is getting crazy. It’s a very big development for eSports.”

Later in the decade, Gotfrag.com would eventually run its own streaming operation (GotFragTV) headed by Scott "SirScoots" Smith, now COO of Evil Geniuses.

"We knew the potential and GotFrag also had some ability to draw in its own advertising." said Midway. “So we took a chance by pushing the streaming. It was a big reason why MLG wanted to work with us too so it helped in many ways. Streaming existed before that we just felt we could get the revenue behind it better than it had been in the past.  If we had the current streaming market back then GotFrag would have been able to do even more.”

The esports caster profession was born here. Much like their sports counterparts, esports commentators are able to frame a competitive gaming match in a way that informs and excites viewers. Their utility was quickly realized as they first emerged and, as streaming became more popular, so too would these personalities who brought the streams to life.

By 2003 and 2004, video streams of major events would reach several tens of thousands of fans.

Prior to streaming, fans knew players chiefly through still photos, hearsay, the occasional interview and, most importantly, the game itself. A player’s personality seems to come through their game. Aggression, creativity, anger, calmness and many more traits are easily identified and magnified when watching a top competitor play. Through this, fans felt they knew players such as HeatoN, Ksharp and Boxer whether or not they’d ever actually heard the men speak or not.

Once streaming (and a reliable supply of videos) became the standard, players transformed to some extent from ideas to actual human beings. They would, however, remain icons first and foremost.

Streams regularly saw upwards of 50,000 viewers tune in to watch *Counter-Strike* events such as the CPL, a number that is only being matched in recent years by a small group of top games. CAL and its European counterparts fostered new talents online while promoting fandom to heights yet unseen in the West.

Early on, it was a hustle.

"I don’t think anyone stood back and looked at it that way [as though they were building an industry]," wrote Midway. “Maybe some of the higher ups in CPL and I may have had a moment or two.  But for the most part your head was down trying to figure out how to do more.  Write the next article or practice for the next big event.  Most of these players just wanted to prove to their parents or fans that they could actually make enough money to not have to get a job.”

As esports grew in the mid-00s in the West, the conversation reached a new volume. How far can esports go? How big can it get? For some, the question was just how much money can we squeeze out of this before it bursts?

While the West was wondering about the potential of esports, the Eastern world was following its own path. In South Korea, the most important and successful esport of the era and possiby of all-time would capture the imagination of a country and do what no Western esport could: become a major national pastime.
