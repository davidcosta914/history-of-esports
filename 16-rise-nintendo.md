# Chapter 16 - Rise of Nintendo (1983-1990)The American game industry suffered greatly in the middle of the 1980s. Headlines were dire, commonly cited as reading one form of “Video Games are Dead” or another. American arcades emptied and the console market suffered a deluge of bad products while prices spiraled downward. Although the rest of the world did not suffer a market collapse as significant as in the US, the Americans’ leading position in the industry meant that the ripples were felt across the globe.The collapse meant the end of an era. American dominance in the industry, the prominence of arcades and several big name companies and products became relics of the past.Still, reports of the industry’s demise were greatly exaggerated. Europe, Canada and, most importantly, Japan carried on into the next era.The Apple II, the IBM PC and the Commodore 64 were notable players during this time. All three were personal computers and, it was assumed, pictures of the future of the industry. Arcades and consoles were given up for dead by many.It was Nintendo, a little known toy company from Japan that had moved into the arcade market, that would become the next great torch bearer in the industry.The Nintendo Famicom (Family Computer) debuted in Japan in 1983. According to The Ultimate History of Video Games, the console sold well in its native country. Three million units were shipped in 18 months.By late 1985, it had been renamed the Nintendo Entertainment System. It entered the American market in New York and immediately became successful enough to justify continued effort on Nintendo’s part to conquer America. Those efforts culminated in the 1986 explosion for the system on the back of a heavyweight marketing and sales campaign as well as a strong company identity. Three million units were sold that year and, according to The Ultimate History of Video Games, sales doubled in the next year. Nintendo and its system have been widely credited with “restarting” video games in the United States.Nintendo games and characters such as Mario, Donkey Kong, Punch Out and Duck Hunt have come to define this era of gaming, an era which reaches into today. Memories of playing these games, particularly Super Mario Bros. and Duck Hunt with my sisters, all of us young and mesmerized by the television in our basement, are among some of the earliest memories I have.1987 saw The Legend of Zelda, Mike Tyson’s Punch Out, Metroid and Castlevania released, some of the most successful and influential games and franchises of the era.In 1990, the Nintendo World Championships were held in Hollywood, California.This is an event in which the ostentation and flamboyant flair for dramatics (it was inspired by the children’s movie The Wizard) may leave the viewer speechless. A few favorite touches from the event include the emcee with his earnestly permed hair, his inexplicable Oscar-worthy tuxedo, his jumping and yelling on stage (“woo!”), the bad jokes, the often directionless and boundless hype, the awesomely poor acting on the part of the clueless commentator and the unbelievably bright, loud and histrionic early-90s aura that permeated the entire thing. This was a time when the volume was often stuck on high. This was an event aimed at children, an aim and aura that gaming (and competitive gaming) would not be able to shake for years despite the aging and maturation of the playing audience.Specialized versions of Super Mario Brothers, Rad Racer, and Tetris were played at the event. Echoing earlier events, scores were “normalized” as follows: (Super Mario Bros.) + (Rad Racer x 10) + (Tetris x 25) equaled the final score.Prizes ranged from $250 for an age group winner to the much heftier top prizes: a $10,000 U.S. Savings Bond, a convertible and a 40’’ TV.Several comparable competitions were held in the first half of the 90s including two more major Nintendo tournaments that received some media attention.As the turn of the decade neared, Nintendo stood atop a renewed video game industry with around 90% of the market. The question on the minds of everyone from investors to competitors to Nintendo executives was simple: would it last?
