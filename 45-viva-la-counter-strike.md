# Chapter 45 - Viva la Counter-Strike (2005-2012)


*Counter-Strike* is dead. Long live *Counter-Strike*!

In *Counter-Strike*’s rich history, it has carved out a unique story. Among its peers in the premiere millenial esports, it is alone in many respects. As *StarCraft* and *Quake* faded in the Western world, *Counter-Strike* has demonstrated its lasting power despite a vocal and numerous crowd of pessimists repeatedly exclaiming the death of the game. 

Although events such as the CGS combined with the simple passing of time have led to a closing of the community (new blood is rare in the competitive community), a significant number of players remain active, a larger number of viewers remain interested and a competitive scene continues on, defiantly and definitely alive.

*Quake* is responsible for many of the first major steps taken by Western PC esports. *StarCraft* is responsible for that role in Korea and for establishing the most successful and sustainable industry infrastructure of all time. In the West, the *Counter-Strike* community is responsible for the financial success of many of the teams and organizations that led Western esports in the past and which lead global esports today.

Teams such as Evil Geniuses and Complexity Gaming are now multi-game powerhouses with a global reach and unparalleled success. Once upon a time, they were just simple (and wildly successful) *Counter-Strike* teams. Mousesports, Check Six Gaming, Fnatic, SK Gaming, Alternate aTTax, Meet Your Maker, mTw, Natus Vincere, Low Land Lions, Against All Authority, eSahara and many more are now major multi-game teams. All of them found major financial success and competitive glory in *Counter-Strike*.

One of the greatest players of *Counter-Strike*’s latter years has been the Swede Patrik "f0rest" Lindberg. Lindberg burst onto the scene in 2005 as one of the best newcomers in the game, leading his team (Begrip) to surprisingly solid results on the back of his play including a shocking $50,000 win at 2005’s World Esports Games, a victory which helped thrust f0rest onto the global stage. 

At the beginning of 2006, a rapidly ascending f0rest joined fnatic, an organization dead set on investing heavily in putting together the best team in the world. With Lindberg as their best player, fnatic did just that.

"Patrik is in many ways an enigma to the fans and the esport press," reads a profile of f0rest by SteelSeries, one of his major sponsors. “Ask any *Counter-Strike 1.6*-fan about his personal life and they will have no answer. He has won an international tournament with his teams for seven consecutive seasons, a feat that has not been replicated by anyone in competitive gaming today, and throughout those seven seasons he has given only two interviews. When he was honored as Counter-Strike Player of the Year in 2006, he simply went on stage, received his award and said ‘Thank you’.”

Even after an exodus that can be in some part be credited to CGS and the financial incentives it offered for players and teams to move to *Counter-Strike: Source*, *1.6* has remained one of the premiere global esports while *Source* simply has not. While the flow of new faces has slowed to a trickle, the *1.6* scene still supports a dynamic and shifting meta-game, still boasts serious star power and still attracts tens of thousands of viewers to its top matches, not to mention the sponsors and cash that come with them.

In the wake of what seemed like the death knell for *Counter-Strike*, 2009 signaled a rebirth. In concert with a general reawakening in esports, *CS* tournaments offered more prize money than ever before according to Slasher.

f0rest was considered the greatest player on fnatic during 2009, the most competitive year in the game’s history to that point when measured by prize money and competitions. To most minds, Lindberg was the greatest player in the world.

"With Fnatic, Lindberg has conquered virtually every tournament there is to win," wrote Miraa at HLTV.org. 

Lindberg earned a then-record breaking $153,122 in prize money during the year. Considered to be the best team in the world, Fnatic cruised to the finals of the 2009 World Cyber Games.

In front of an enormous and loud crowd in Chengdu, China, Fnatic would face the Polish team and the former WCG champions AGAiN to decide who would be the WCG 2009 champion.

AGAiN’s star player was Filip "Neo" Kubski. Neo has been the leading force in Poland’s rise to prominence in *Counter-Strike* since his days with Pentagram in 2004. In 2005, the team and its star broke out with major international wins and, finally, 2006 brought them unquestionably into the elite tier with wins at WSVG and WCG. With his jaw-dropping aim, Neo was voted Player of the Decade by *CS* news site HLTV.org, winning over the biggest *Counter-Strike* names of all time including f0rest, elemeNt and HeatoN. It must be noted that while Neo is a very talented player, the Player of the Decade vote was a popularity contest and not much more. The Poles lined up and voted for their favorite in droves.

When the teams and players were introduced to the Chinese crowd in Chengdu before the finals, there can be no doubt that f0rest and Neo were the two men who received the loudest cheers, thunderous efforts from their many thousands of fans half a world away from the players’ homes in Sweden and Poland.

Fnatic and AGAiN produced a classic struggle for the ecstatic Chinese fans. Following a closely contested match, the game was forced into four overtimes and several crucial situations in which each player was tested in the spotlight.

"With the [overtime] score 27-26 in favor of AgaiN, fnatic's GeT_RighT had a large health advantage over a 20 health LordB," wrote Breslau for Kotaku. “GeT_RighT would lose his second crucial 1 v 1 moment of the match, giving AgaiN the win. They would go on to win the second map 16-12, and take their second WCG title. Fnatic has never won the World Cyber Games.”

"We really did not expect to win the match in two maps, it was not easy, I have to say, Nuke [the first map] was the toughest and the longest game we have ever played, and it is one of the best games in the history of Counter-Strike," said AGAiN star Wiktor "TaZ" Wojtas to HLTV.org.

As other esports have seen progress in recent years by growing their audiences with viewers and players who are completely new to esports, *Counter-Strike* maintained a steady player base for what feels like eons without promise of a new game.

Now, *Counter-Strike: Global Offensive* has once again raised questions on *CS*’s competitive future. 

ESCW 2011’s *Counter-Strike* competition boasted approximately 50,000 concurrent viewers. While that seems somewhat pale in comparison to the six figure numbers being put up by the world’s largest esports, it hardly denotes a dying esport.

*Counter-Strike*’s future remains a question mark as *GO* and *1.6* will both present interesting and tempting options for the competitive scene. Whether or not *GO* will provide a viable competitive sport remains to be seen.

Either way, it is near impossible to imagine an esports world without at least one flavor of *Counter-Strike* chugging along, playing eternal.
