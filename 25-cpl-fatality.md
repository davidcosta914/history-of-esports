# Chapter 25 - The CPL and Fatal1ty (1997-2004)

Say what you will about the man -- and there is so very much that has been said -- but, undeniably, Angel Munoz is an enormous figure in competitive gaming’s history. A polarizing man for reasons both professional and personal, Munoz is a pioneer in the industry.

A Dallas stockbroker who grew up in Puerto Rico, Munoz walked away from investment banking in 1995 and set about building "the first ever organized and full sponsored video gaming tournament," wrote Michael Kane in Game Boys.

Munoz founded the Cyberathlete Professional League in January 1997 after bearing witness to 90s LAN parties and tournaments. Munoz decided to pursue what he saw as the vast untapped commercial potential of competitive gaming.

The CPL’s first event (dubbed "The FRAG" for Foremost Roundup of Advanced Gamers) attracted 300 people in a small room with a low ceiling and a dirty rug. The event’s location has been unfavorably compared to a parking garage. 

Still, The FRAG was deemed a success in the only contexts that mattered. For the players, it was a worthwhile tournament and the beginning of a more serious competitive circuit. For Munoz, it was the beginning of a profitable enterprise. As Michael Kane writes in Game Boys, the CPL began as a "tidy in-the-black business model" - profitable from the start - and grew from there.

1998 saw the CPL take over the year’s QuakeCon event (the event was even dubbed "The CPL Event" according to GotFrag.com). Later that year, The FRAG 2 was held in Dallas. Boasting a $15,000 prize pool and most of the greatest *Quake* talent in the world (minus Thresh), the event helped to cement the CPL’s position within the newborn competitive gaming industry.

Angel Munoz’s goal for the CPL was to aggressively mainstream competitive gaming. For years, Munoz sought and secured major sponsors with an unrivaled success rate. Munoz won millions of dollars in sponsorships from major companies such as Intel and Nvidia during his tenure at CPL. His ultimate target was television, living rooms across the world and the dedicated eyes of millions of fans. 

Few things would help accomplish that goal as effectively as a true gaming superstar. 

The dream for many in esports and for Munoz in particular was to build stars bigger than Tomo Ohira. Tomo was a player who was famous in arcades worldwide, even appearing in passing in major gaming magazines. However, he never made a significant splash in the mainstream.

The dream was to build stars bigger than Billy Mitchell, a player whose medium had long since passed him by.

The dream was to build stars bigger than Thresh. Thresh was a player whose consistent success in and out of games still inspires fandom to this day. However, he was never set on becoming the Michael Jordan of competitive gaming, an icon determined to push both the game and the business to new heights.

Enter Fatal1ty.

Jonathan "Fatal1ty" Wendel began his competitive gaming career in 1999 when, after two months of single-minded training, the then 18 year old American famously used the last $500 in his bank account for a trip to Dallas, Texas to play *Quake 3: Arena* at a CPL tournament dubbed FRAG 3. It is a story that has been told over and over again.

"I told my dad I’m going to this tournament," said Wendel in 2008’s Frag documentary. “I have $500 in the bank and I’m pushing all in. If I win any significant money, I’m going to keep doing it. If I don’t win any money, hey, I’m done.”

A third place finish at the tournament earned Wendel $4,000 and justification to continue toward a truly professional gaming career. His dad could only smile. 

The high finish also garnered an invite to Sweden to compete against 12 of the best *Quake 3* players in the world. Wendel’s dominant first place finish in Sweden included an 18-game winning streak and secured a $15,000 payday for the rising star.

Fatal1ty’s chief advantage in game was that he was the first player to properly practice. Often overlooked, practice ability is a valuable skill in and of itself no matter the endeavor. Being able to put in consistent and productive practice is something that often separates good from great in any discipline. Fatal1ty’s single minded-training in 1999 and then his subsequent sponsorship allowed him to practice in a way that few other players were able to during the era. He took advantage of the opportunity.

At the time, most *Quake* players (such as Blue, Makaveli and LakermaN) relied heavily on aim (not Fatal1ty’s strong suit) and intuition. That breed of player could hit thrilling acrobatic shots and arguably possessed more raw talent than Wendel.

On the other hand, Wendel built a well-rounded game on a disciplined and efficient practice routine. While other players would enter a match confident that their aim would carry them to victory (especially on maps such as tourney4 which tended to emphasize raw aim), Fatal1ty would play a different, higher game. The American outworked everyone else and, through his deliberately grown skill, he controlled the map, himself and the game better than any of his peers.

Fatal1ty’s gaming acumen was matched by his business savvy. Wendel proactively secured major sponsorship deals for himself. As would become increasingly clear over the length of his career, Fatal1ty was intent on building a brand entirely his own.

Two months after his win in Sweden, Wendel returned to Dallas for the 2000 CPL. Once again competing in *Quake 3*, Wendel won the event and the $40,000 first place prize (from a total pool of $100,000), earning the first of what would become several world championships.

In 2000, Wendel won around $100,000 in *Quake 3* prize money alone at tournaments that included CPL and the World Cyber Games Challenge (WCGC), an Olympics-inspired competition that would grow into one of the more important institutions in the esports world as the WCG.

Fatal1ty’s career spanned several games. In 2001, Wendel captured his second CPL world championship in the deathmatch FPS *Aliens vs. Predator 2*, a game whose notorious imbalance helped cut its lifespan short. A new Ford Focus (painted green and black and covered with *AvP* insignia) was added to a $40,000 first place prize.

In 2002, Wendel captured yet another world championship at CPL Winter in Dallas. This time, the game was *Unreal Tournament 2003*, another deathmatch 1v1 FPS focused on competitive multiplayer by design in the style of *QuakeWorld* and, later, *Quake 3: Arena*. Wendel won $10,000 for his efforts.

Fatal1ty’s wins and the growing esports circuit captured the attention of the world in and outside of gaming many times. For mainstream media outlets in America such as Forbes, 60 Minutes, The New York Times and Time, this 20-something was leading a life worth talking about. Media stories about Wendel often treated the boy as a novelty, a youngin leading an interesting if foreign lifestyle that, for better or worse, often left the older journalists shaking their heads in amazement. Condescension, ignorance and laziness have littered mainstream journalists’ attempts at covering esports since the dawn of time. Coverage of Fatal1ty was not always terribly different.

In these pieces from the 2000s, Wendel was often referred to as "the most famous gamer in the world" by journalists at the expense of ignored esports industries in Asia and Europe.

As far as mainstream exposure is concerned, the height of Fatal1ty’s visibility can likely be pinpointed to March 13, 2003. This was the day that MTV’s documentary series True Life featured Wendel’s first place *Unreal Tournament 2003* run at Winter CPL 2002 as part of an hour long episode focusing on gamers in general.

"Overall, the most accomplished player is definitely Fatal1ty," said esports journalist and tournament organizer Michal Blicharz (Carmac) in 2008. “Gamers like Fatal1ty who are very very successful, especially from a financial point of view, are really very good examples of what you can do if you are very talented and very motivated.”

Fatal1ty’s success was a symptom of a growing esport. That growth benefited those around him. In 2004, Chinese player Yang "RocketBoy" Meng defeated Wendel in a game of *Doom 3* and earned $120,000, a record. RocketBoy won the 2004 *Doom 3* CPL championship.

Gamers such as Fatal1ty were a major boon to Munoz’s vision of a video game league mimicking and rivaling the National Football League, far and away America’s most popular and profitable American sports institution.

However, even the luminous star of Fatal1ty couldn’t keep deathmatch games on top of the Western world forever. Soon, a new game would carry the torch forward.
