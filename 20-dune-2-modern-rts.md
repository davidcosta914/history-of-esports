# Chapter 20 - Dune 2 and the modern RTS (1992)

By the 1990s, PCs had a long and distinguished history in gaming. Commodores (VIC-20s and 64s) and Apple IIs sported enormous libraries of games. 

Additionally, an entire generation of programmers was raised on the Apple II during the 80s. They would come to prominence at the turn of the decade and produce some of the most successful games of the 90s and beyond, helping further build up PCs as gaming machines.

The real time strategy (RTS) genre as we know it today was sired in 1992 with the release of Westwood Studios’ *Dune II: The Building of a Dynasty*. The term RTS came into use with this game thanks to *Dune 2*’s designer Brett Sperry.

After two decades of evolution, many core characteristics of the modern RTS can be traced directly to *Dune 2*.

*Dune 2’*s visuals set the standard for the genre. The minimap, the command box and the playing screen are all implemented here in ways that are mimicked twenty years later in games such as *StarCraft 2*. Units built by gathered resources - spices, in *Dune*'s case - were pioneered here. This is the first title which adheres to the now genre-defining model: "Harvest, build, destroy". In fact, a myriad of now taken-for-granted features first saw the light of day in the sands of *Dune*: Tech trees, army asymmetry, mouse-operated gameplay and total war 'till elimination all originated here.

The game is undeniably slow even when compared to its immediate successors. As later games such as *Warcraft* and *Command & Conquer* would reveal, a game that makes speed a core part of play is a game where creativity is more often showcased. When a player has to solve more problems, make more decisions and do it all more quickly, the good are soon separated from the great. The skill ceiling is higher and gaps emerge, better players beat inferior opponents more often and, when the solutions are varied, a competitive game is able to sustain itself for longer periods of time.

By far, the single biggest difference between *Dune 2* and its successors was *Dune’*s lack of multiplayer. The entire genre would soon be defined by its multiplayer modes, eventually rising to become the most important competitive genre on the planet for at least some time. Whereas single player games presented finite albeit fun challenges for gamers, facing off against fellow humans meant a potentially infinite battle of wits that would change the face of gaming forever.

If Westwood Studios had known in 1992, the same year *Dune 2* was released, that online gaming would soon rise and change video games forever, perhaps they would have waited just a few months.

Instead, the glory of modern online gaming belongs in large part to the storied id Software thanks to their successful stable of games from 1992 and on.
