# Chapter 38 - The decline and fall of the CPL (post-2005)

Upon entering a major tournament, one is immediately struck by both the largeness and the smallness of the thing.

After watching esports solely online, walking into a big tournament can be an awe-inspiring moment. Finally standing face to face with thousands of fans, hundreds of players, hundreds of employees and the hundreds of thousands of square feet within which they dwell can disorient you with its enormity. Stepping from the online to the physical is a major border to cross.

On the other hand, the intimacy of the event is apparent as the initial awe wears off. 

If you are at the Super Bowl, you will never meet Tom Brady. At the World Cup, Messi will not greet you. 

You can, however, meet and shake hands with Daigo and Justin Wong on the floor of Evo. They might even celebrate a victory with you. Boxer will sign an autograph for you if you catch him at the right time (make sure his wife Jessica his preoccupied because she watches him like a mother grizzly), f0rest will only be a few feet away from you as he competes for a world championship. 

For much of esports history, most of the recognizable and revered faces in competitive gaming have been close to fans in every respect of the word. They owe much of their success to their membership in the fraternity that is the global esports community.

Even today, the phenomenon persists to a significant extent.

From the 1990s on, competitive gaming has seen a number of major international competitions enter and exit the scene.

"What’s really significant is that the CPL created an industry where a lot of companies are involved with millions of dollars, a multimillion dollar industry," said Angel Munoz in the  Frag documentary. “The brand of the CPL is still the highest flag, the one that everyone would like to be involved with.”

If 2004 was the peak of the CPL, as Munoz and GotFrag’s Midway said it was, then 2005 was the beginning of the decline. That was the year that the CPL began its World Tour, a ten-stop competition including a $500,000 grand final in New York City. As you’ve read the game in focus was the new and untested title *Painkiller*, a deathmatch FPS that served as the face of a memorable but unsuccessful 2005 season. *Painkiller* was replaced by 2006.

The radical change in format and the instituting of a new and untested game as the headlining title were perceivably reckless gambles that did not pay off for the CPL. The same was true for the CPL’s attempts to gain sustained mainstream exposure through television and media deals. After the 2004 departure of Frank Nuccio, Angel Munoz was largely responsible for many of the new directions the league was taking.

"I think the World Tour is the biggest mistake the CPL ever made, I don’t even think there’s a question," said Trevor "Midway" Schmidt. “That goes hand in hand with the fact that Frank Nuccio was no longer around, the only sane guy over there. It’s funny to hear Angel say 2004 [was the apex of the CPL] because he started making all the decisions around that time and he screwed it all up. It’s typical of Angel Munoz to try to take credit for everybody else’s work.”

By 2006, major sponsors such as Intel were abandoning the CPL for greener pastures with new rivals. Specifically, Intel made camp with the World Series of Video Games. The WSVG would go on to buy the rights to the CPL and took over the World Tour stops, invested significant sums of cash into advertising, made grand plans for television (it was featured on MTV) and, finally, invested hundreds of thousands into their prize pool.

"In truth, few tears were shed inside gaming for the marginalized Munoz," wrote Michael Kane in Game Boys. Kane went on to quote several ex-employees, gamers and industry figures as they accused Munoz of underpaying employees, intentionally and illegally skipping out on prize payments to gamers and becoming increasingly focused on a shortsighted and single-minded run for quick profit. 

As opposed to seeing the big picture, having a sane and long-term business plan for esports, Munoz was running the CPL event to event, check to check and dollar to dollar in a way that alienated him from the gamers he claimed to champion in public.

Although GotFrag.com’s founder Midway has said on multiple occasions that Angel was dangerous and that he took advantage of people within the industry and left them out in the cold, GotFrag itself became increasingly less willing to genuinely take the CPL on in the way that an objective news outlet would be expected to. Midway has said that his greatest regret regarding GotFrag is not going after the CPL when they deserved it.

>The reason we didn’t was because we kept hoping that Angel or the CPL would turn the corner toward something bigger. At the end of the day, the WCG [was not significant for us in the West], there was no CGS, ESL was nothing at this point. It was CPL and then everything else and everything else was a fraction of what the CPL was. For us at the time, we’d already seen what happened when we didn’t work with the CPL. We got banned from events. So we tried to work with the CPL to see if we couldn’t do more and try to build the community up the way that ESPN partners with the NFL. We tried that.

>We talked to the teams and talked to the players and we knew that people weren’t getting paid on a certain level but we had assurances on the side that those people were going to get paid. We were tracking it but at the end of the day we didn’t push forward with those articles. Looking back, that is something that we could have done, that we should have done but we made the decision to not do it.

When one compares these words from GotFrag’s founder in 2011 with the effusive praise heaped onto CPL by GotFrag around 2005, the contrast is striking.

"After eight years of profiting off teenagers, you’ve got to wonder if anyone besides Munoz and his sponsors has made any real money in the niche industry," wrote Michael Kane.

The relationship between GotFrag and CPL highlights the need for multiple major independent news outlets in the esports industry.

Figures as well known as Fatal1ty were running into major issues when attempting to cash their prize checks.

The CPL was founded in 1997 and was, at that point, alone in the newly born esports industry. In the next decade, major esports organizations sprouted up across the globe. 

Starting in 2000, the World Cyber Games (WCG) took the international Olympics and applied the format and aesthetic to competitive gaming. The organization has survived through 2011 with relatively stable business thanks in large part to their major sponsor and organizer in Samsung.

In 2002, Major League Gaming (MLG) was formed in the United States. Initially focused on console gaming (with games such as *Halo 2* and *Super Smash Brothers Melee*), the MLG has weathered several booms and busts and, as of 2011, is moving toward PC gaming to become one of the most well known leagues in the world. It is the most watched league in the world as of 2011. It has depended heavily on venture capital as opposed to outright profit to this point and is, at time of printing, still not a profitable company.

In 2003, the Electronic Sports World Cup (ESWC) was born in France. Quickly praised for its organization and presentation, the FIFA World Cup-inspired event has endured sporadically into 2011.

In 2005, the World Esports Games (WEG) established lucrative *Counter-Strike* and *Warcraft 3* events taking place over the course of two months in Seoul, South Korea. With prizes nearing one million dollars, early seasons attracted major competitors but faded away later in the decade.

In Korea, *StarCraft* and *Warcraft* boasted numerous televised leagues, national attention and a level of stability that was head and shoulders above all others in the industry.

In Germany and Europe as a whole, the Electronic Sports League (ESL) grew, providing steady competition in various RTS, FPS and sports games.

In many ways, the most significant organization to rear its head during this era was the Championship Gaming Series (CGS). In fact, the rise and fall of CGS can be said to bookmark the end of the era which began in the early 2000s with the CPL’s growth. The CGS’s grandiose ambitions had a profound impact on teams, players, sponsors and the esports industry as a whole.
