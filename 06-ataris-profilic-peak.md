# Chapter 6 - Atari’s Prolific Peak (1972)Pong (released in 1972) spawned an industry. “By September 1974, 100,000 coin-operated video games were in operation around the US, raking in $250 million a year,” wrote Tristan Donovan in Replay.Meanwhile, Atari, which would become the fastest growing company in American history up to that point, attempted to move beyond it to other games. Although they continued to pump out Pong clones like the rest of the industry, Atari also created a maze game called Gotcha (which inspired Pac-Man), a racing game called Trak 10 and numerous other unsung games which often invented genres and were then unceremoniously forgotten by the public at large for a time.As the video game industry grew, competition within the industry intensified. Competition within games followed shortly thereafter.In 1974, an Atari subsidiary dubbed Kee Games produced Tank. It was simple: a player controlled a tank and fought his opponent while avoiding walls and mines. The visuals were unadorned, the gameplay was clean and quick. It was a hit.The last game Bushnell would create at Atari was called Breakout, a single player remix of Pong: twist one paddle 90 degrees to the bottom of the screen, replace the other with a wall of colorful bricks and let the ball break out of the wall. Voilà: another hit.Steve Jobs, an employee at Atari who was already hard at work developing the Apple II with Steve Wozniak by this point, played an integral role by bringing Wozniak in to attempt to minimize the cost of the hardware for the new game.As the medium moved forward, ground breaking ideas were passing nearly unnoticed by the world.
