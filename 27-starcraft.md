# Chapter 27 - StarCraft (1998)

On March 31, 1998, *StarCraft* was released in the West. Thanks in large part to a major migration of players from *Warcraft 2*, a serious competitive scene was established even during the beta. In November 1998, the expansion pack *Brood War* was released and *StarCraft*’s competitive scene grew rapidly.

*StarCraft* is a game that builds directly on the foundations of the *Warcrafts* and *Dunes* which preceded it. Although the foundation is much the same, the guts of the game vary significantly. 

*StarCraft* is significantly faster than its predecessors, a fact that would push its skill ceiling at least as high as any esport has ever been. *StarCraft* possesses variety in quantities far greater than its predecessors: three different races each have their own unique characteristics, strengths and weaknesses. In *StarCraft*, every choice you made was magnified in importance well beyond what was possible in any previous RTS title. 

The player was in full control in *StarCraft*. Almost purely on the strength of that player’s abilities, he or she could produce a masterpiece of a game in a way that few if any had ever seen before.

In 1999, the game was released in Korea. Christopher "Pillars" Page was an American who was one of the first sponsored gamers ever along with other *StarCraft* founding fathers such as the Swede Victor "[9]eVERLAST" Martin (who earned nearly $2,500 a month for a time) and Thresh.

Pillars spent four months as a professional gamer in Korea in 2000 and helped explain the rise of South Korean *StarCraft.*

"Both *Starcraft* and *SC:BW* were released later in Korea, and it took them a while to get up to speed," said Pillars. "What one noticed about them at first was the relatively mechanical and robotic style of play. The way many Koreans seemed to learn to play was to master a single racial match-up on a single map and come as close as possible to perfecting it. They followed build orders rigorously, and often very efficiently, but didn't adapt well to new situations or creative responses by their opponents. Often they would play a moderately strong game for the first ten minutes of the match, but once the game became more dynamic and opened up a bit they would have difficulty doing anything other than throwing the same mixture of units at you over and over again. Obviously, this didn't remain the case for long."

For two years, the players on top of the game were non-Koreans. Players such as Tom "Zileas" Cadwell (now the director for *League of Legends*), Miguel "Maynard" Bombach ("invincible" during his reign) and Guillaume "Grrrr..." Patry were some of the most innovative and important minds in the early era of *StarCraft*.

South Korea had had the world’s fastest growing economy for much of the 1990s after emerging from decades of poverty. For much of the decade and beyond, the country experienced a major tech boom. The entire country was being wired and the economy was expanding to the point of South Korea becoming an "Asian Tiger", one of several highly developed economies with continued exceptional rates of growth. 

As the country broadly connected to the internet, a significant but passing 1997 financial crisis hit. *StarCraft*, a cheap and prolific form of entertainment that fit well into an extremely wired nation, caught the attention of millions.

A tournament scene quickly developed in the major metropolitan areas in and around the capital Seoul thanks in large part to the proliferation of PC Bangs, Korean internet cafes which became key hubs in the nation at about this time. Both phenomenons, *StarCraft* and PC Bangs, owe each other credit.

Upon realizing *StarCraft*’s significant and growing popularity, Korean television stations aired the best competitions. When that proved popular as well, competitive gaming was eventually given dedicated channels that the faithful have supported for over a decade.

Korean esports are regulated by the Korean e-Sports Association (KeSPA). Founded in 2000 after the approval of the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism, KeSPA’s stated goal is to make esports an official sporting event and to push and solidify esports at new commercial heights.

The most important and revered *StarCraft* competition has its roots in this era. The OSL (OnGameNet Starleague) has a pedigree unlike any other esports competition in the entire world. It was the first regularly televised esports event and, when other *StarCraft* competitions such as the MSL joined the television fray, the OSL remained higher rated. Its live audience numbers were higher than almost any other event. Its champions are esports royalty due in no small part to their wins on the biggest stage in *StarCraft*.

While the CPL, long the pinnacle of Western gaming, was holding biannual events with just north of 1,000 people in the live audience for any particular game, the OSL and MSL had dedicated television channels and were packing arenas on a weekly basis with crowds that could number over 10,000 and, on the biggest days, well over 100,000. The OSL’s prize began at $15,000, clearly the largest regular individual prize of the time. More recently in 2010, the first place prize hit almost $90,000, still one of the most impressive totals in esports.

The first true celebrity of *StarCraft* was Guillaume "Grrrr..." Patry.

Grrrr...’s ascendancy began in 1999. Encouraged by his father, the Protoss player attended and won several major competitions around the world and online. The AMD Professional Gaming League, which boasted Atari founder Nolan Bushnell as the commissioner and was only short-lived rival to the CPL, fell to Grrrr....

Although PGL’s lifespan was short, it was an important event. Its prize pools (over $8,000 for first place) rival and exceed many modern tournaments such as Major League Gaming’s offerings in 2011. The i2e2 tournament, boasting probably the second highest prize pool in *StarCraft*, also fell to Grrrr... in 1999. On his landing in Korea in January 2000, he was the most feared player in the world.

Grrrr..., a handsome young man seemingly made for television, won three televised tournaments within three months of his arrival in Korea. He quickly became the most famous *StarCraft* player in the world and, for a time, the most famous gamer period. No one else in the esports world was being stopped in the street and begged for autographs with the frequency and ferocity that Patry was.

Ironically, Grrrr...’s arrival in Korea, the move that would give him unparalleled fame, money and a new home country, would also signal the start of his decline in the game.

"I was irresponsible," said Patry. “I regret it. I was drinking almost every day. I loved the food, the culture, the people. The night before the final of the OSL [championship match], I was out until 4 am. I didn't get drunk. I won but I really could have used the practice. I knew I was drinking too much when I showed up for tournaments late and my hands would be shaking from being hungover."

To this day, he remains the only foreign player to have won a Korean Starleague, a feat which alone has secured his place as one of the greatest and most revered players of all time. While Grrrr...’s decline in Korea was apparent, he possessed an uncanny knack to deliver when the pressure would devastate most competitors.

"I won the televised tournaments but that's all I won," said Patry. "There were many offline tournaments which I lost but no one saw them. People used to say 'you have to put a camera on this guy for him to play well.'"

Even as the most successful player at the beginning of the television era in *StarCraft* and esports as a whole, Grrrr... suffered from what is a standard complaint from any gamer who played in those days and many beyond: dishonest businessmen.

While the Western world was busy learning its lessons with empty promises of sponsorships and prize pools left unpaid, the *StarCraft* world endured similar problems.

Grrrr...’s trip to Korea was taken with fellow Western greats Maynard, Pillars and Jérôme "[9]Thor" Rioux. "General~Khalsa", a well-known member of the Kali community offered to start a foreign *StarCraft* team in Korea to take advantage of the exploding tournament circuit in the country. 

"This seemed like a pretty insane and fun opportunity," wrote Pillars in 2008, "and I eventually decided to go. The four of us showed up in Korea in early 2000. We stayed in the international dorm section of a prominent women's college (Ewha Women's University) in Seoul for the first few months and made Slki Bang (the internet cafe and home to the best Korean professional team of the time) our training space."

The dream of becoming great in Korea came true for only one of the players: Guillaume Patry. In an era where perfect technical play in *StarCraft* was a distant dream, Grrrr... stormed through opponents with relative ease for a time.

Despite his role in bringing Patry to Korea, Grrrr... does not remember "General~Khalsa" fondly.

"[Khalsa] is a piece of shit," said Patry in 2010. "He started ripping us off and laughing, saying 'this is business.' He had under-aged kids live across the world, I think what he was doing was more than business. If only he knew pro gaming would be around for ten years, I think his approach would have been different. Say we had a contract that said he takes pretty much 40% of everything I made and provides housing. We get a sponsor for 8,000 a month for me. He gives me 4,000 a month and stops paying for rent. It was a free for all back then. I don't think there's a single gamer that played in 2000 who is not owed money."

Eventually, Grrrr...’s age and an understandable lack of singleminded dedication caught up to him. Although he stayed competitive, the Canadian never won another major competition.

The man who followed Grrrr...’s reign is *StarCraft*’s greatest celebrity, the most revered esports icon of all time, voted the greatest gamer of all time by ESReality (a major esports site with a focus on *Quake*), the man who revolutionized the Terran race and whose influence on the game and on the business is still felt today. 

As a testament to his fame, Lim "SlayerS_BoxeR" Yo Hwan’s story is known in great detail by an army of fans in South Korea and abroad.

BoxeR became enamored of *StarCraft* as soon as he saw it. First playing at a friend’s house, he quickly took to the game as though it was his job. Like so many before him, nothing made the young Korean happier than good, hard work of his choosing.

*StarCraft* became an obsession by BoxeR’s own admission, the focus of his thoughts and emotion both day and night. He felt flush with happiness when he was able to do something seemingly as simple as defeat the computer. Straining to improve, BoxeR found his purpose after a tumultuous childhood. *StarCraft* was, as he describes it, the light at the end of the dark tunnel.

"BoxeR left the arcades and soccer fields behind," I wrote in a profile for SK-Gaming.com. “He entered a new world in which a computer game gave him the power to express and experience his imagination in a way which excited him to no end. He discovered PC Bangs, Korean internet cafes, and began to learn the intricacies of the game, the worldwide community that it held. At school, he befriended other StarCraft players and soon learned what it meant to win.”

1999 saw him enter his first competitions and, eventually, become a full-time professional player.

The 2001 OSL was the next mountain to climb. Winning 11 games and losing 1 (to Kingdom, one of the great Protoss players of the era), BoxeR’s win-lose record only scratches the surface of his achievement. BoxeR changed the way the game was played, altering perceptions of fundamental units. The Vulture is now an essential Terran unit where before it was deemed too weak to be effective.

From there, he became known as "The Hope of Terran." It is a powerful name but, in retrospect, seems quaint in its naivete. He is more than that. He is The Emperor. But not yet.

My SK-Gaming.com profile continued.

"In the next Starleague in the middle of 2001, his play continued to impress. He made use of units and abilities that had not garnered a second thought prior to his play. He stretched single units far beyond their prescribed strength. As his fame increased, his schedule put pressure on him that he had never before felt.

"It was during this tournament that he would first vie against his greatest rival, ‘The Storm Zerg’ YellOw, for a championship. BoxeR describes YellOw’s play as much like his own: offensive, relentless and hungry. YellOw was something like a younger brother, BoxeR said, but competition is heartless.

"The finals were a spectacle to behold. Back and forth with superior technique and imagination behind the play, BoxeR won one of the most exciting championship matches to that point. He beat an exceedingly talented YellOw and earned even greater admiration from fans to say nothing of the considerable cash prizes he’d laid claim to. He’d established a rivalry that would remain one of the greatest of all time. From that moment, he was no longer simply The Hope of Terran. He was The Emperor, a global symbol for the beauty and potential in esports."

In my 2011 book "The *StarCraft* Bible," I wrote this about BoxeR:

"Ironically, [the then recently released version] 1.08 ended the era of patched balance changes [in *StarCraft*], so as to [ostensibly] balance the game perfectly right before an unheard of 20 year old came out of the dark arcades and showed that in *StarCraft*, factional balance meant little when genius was at hand.

"His unquestioned supremacy, his unparalleled charisma in game and out as well the maturing of the professional circuit meant that he has remained the iconic figure in *StarCraft* history, nearer to Michael Jordan or Diego Maradona than to most other esports stars. His popularity helped raise professional gaming to a new plateau in Korea [and abroad] and the widespread love of BoxeR has long outlasted his spectacular results.

"The President of the Korean eSports Association (KeSPA) had this to say about BoxeR when writing the introduction to the legend's biography:

"‘Lim Yohwan, with the thorough mentality of a professional as his foundation, has imprinted on the minds of the public through his sincere games that pro gamers are not 'game-addicts without any prudence,' but 'hard-working professionals.'’

"BoxeR is one of the few esports professionals who transcends not only the game he plays but, often, escapes the box of games altogether and slips comfortably into the expansive idea of greatness."

BoxeR won an unprecedented two straight Starleagues in 2001 and lost in the finals of a third to GARIMTO in one of the most talked-about upsets in *StarCraft* history. BoxeR also won a KPGA Tour in 2002.

One of the most significant wins in BoxeR’s career and the win that he says he is most proud of came in the World Cyber Games during the 2001 event. With the world watching and with the self-imposed pressure to prove the worth of professional gaming to its detractors and to the unconverted, BoxeR overcame surprisingly potent foreign opponents such as the Frenchman Bertrand "ElkY" Grospellier (now a major professional poker player) to become a true world champion. With the win and the global attention that followed, his star had never been higher.

The following year proved much more difficult for BoxeR. He faltered early in the Korean leagues and felt thoroughly exhausted.

"I was in need of a championship," he said of this time. “And very urgently.”

The 2002 WCG afforded him that championship. Again facing a surprisingly stout foreign field of players, BoxeR eventually won the gold medal over YellOw and, once more, the eyes of the world were fixed on its greatest gamer.

That year, BoxeR signed a contract for a salary of $90,000 (not including prize money and endorsements) and formed one of the most successful *StarCraft* teams of all time (SK Telecom T1). 

BoxeR suffered from exhaustion in the face of the endless competition he put himself though. Partially as a result, his play was no longer what it was once but the Emperor’s overall career seemed to be in excellent shape. BoxeR would go on to personally mentor, groom and eventually lose to the most dominant *StarCraft* player of all time (iloveoov). Despite losing the #1 spot in the Korean ranking system (to NaDa and then iloveoov), BoxeR’s celebrity and coaching ability afforded him a new $180,000 contract and a fan club exceeding half a million members worldwide.

This level of popularity and success exceeded by far every professional gamer before him.

Seiji of PGR21.com described BoxeR’s standing in this way:

>In the NBA, Michael Jordan was but one athlete, but had the influencing power beyond that of a mere basketball player. It is safe to say that because of his presence, the NBA grew rapidly and basketball was no longer the American game, but an international sport. Would it be an overstatement if one were to say that Lim Yohwan has a value like Michael Jordan? The greatest significance Lim Yohwan has towards esports is that he has transformed it from a festival of mere maniacs to a mainstream culture that is now broadcasted by the media. His value can be seen as he raised the understanding of what was once considered as a mere childish game to the dignified acceptance by all as part of the mainstream culture.

BoxeR’s importance is two-fold. 

Out of game, he is charismatic, ambitious, professional and confident.

In game, he retains many of these traits. His play is ambitious, charismatic, creative and unwilling to yield to convention. Much of BoxeR’s play can be fairly categorized as cheesy (meaning it is risky play designed to take an opponent by surprise rather than to defeat them purely on the basis of mechanics) but would have to be taken into the greater context of his play overall to be fully appreciated.

One of BoxeR’s more memorable season’s was the 2004 Starleague. By this point, BoxeR was ranked 11th in Korea, a relatively steep fall for a player who was once clearly the greatest in the world. Many pundits reduced BoxeR to irrelevance, saying the old legend was over the hill and in the ditch.

With this tournament, BoxeR engineered what became a trademark for him, one of his many stubborn refusals to disappear quietly.

After excellent play in the group and playoff stages, BoxeR advanced to the semifinals to face off against YellOw, known by now as "The King of Silver" for his penchant to lose in the final stages of major tournaments. These two were titans of the game just years prior, deemed ambassadors to the world, and both had managed simultaneous magical seasons to advance to this point.

Against an opponent who knew first hand of BoxeR’s propensity toward unorthodox play and toward cheese, BoxeR aggressively bunker rushed YellOw in three straight games and advanced to the finals of the Starleague to the cheers of thousands. The three straight bunker rushes remain one of the most talked about gambits in esports history.

In the finals, BoxeR’s opponent was one that he had personally chosen, groomed, coached and helped raise to the level of most statistically dominant player of all time: The Terran iloveoov. The match was framed as master versus student but at that point, with iloveoov already atop the *StarCraft* world having won three straight MSL titles, the roles blurred.

"Oov knows me so well that I almost feel like I am going against myself in the final," said BoxeR. “They say the most difficult fight in the world is the one you wage with yourself and I think I understand that sentiment.”

One of the most highly anticipated championship matches of all time lived up the hype and then some. Iloveoov and BoxeR traded tense games, some of the most spectacular moments of BoxeR’s storied career, each player walking a high-wire with their contrasting styles clashing, their monumental understandings of the game serving as powerful weapons before iloveoov beat BoxeR in the fifth and deciding game.

After being emotionally and mentally drained, BoxeR wept on stage. After being BoxeR’s teammate, protege and friend, iloveoov described the championship as bitter, something he would never like to repeat.

In victory or defeat, BoxeR has long stood for something more in esports.
