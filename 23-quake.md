# Chapter 23 - Quake (1996)

The next major game from id Software was 1996’s *Quake*. 

Competitive *Quake* is at first glance deathly simple much like its predecessors. Two opponents are in a small arena littered with a dozen weapons, a few types of armor and all the possibilities in the world. There’s nothing to do but kill the other man and, in ten minutes, the highest kill count wins.

The duel begins with a booming voice commanding you to ‘Fight!’. Next, the simplicity slams into you at 100 miles per hour. 

Immediately, a powerful weapon is sitting in front of the competitors and they sprint to it. 

The entire atmosphere in *Quake* is frantic from the colors to the music to, of course, the speed. Every step, even at a mind-numbing sprint, will resonate through the game. Players work to achieve ideal positioning as they fight a tactical and strategic battle, all the while shooting for perfect aim through the fire and lightning raining down upon them.

*Quake* takes a minute to learn and an instant to enjoy watching. It is deceptively deep. Each weapon requires different tactics. Each arena allows for a multitude of styles and each player is allowed creative freedom. 

The physical side of the game complements the manic mind game. The game is an endless pursuit of perfection in aiming the weapons of *Quake*’s arsenal. The two sides of the game, the mental and physical intertwine unpredictably. They form one of the most enduring esports in the world.

*Quake* would launch a franchise that is not only still fiercely loved but also played religiously by a loyal group of gamers in competitions even in 2012.

*Quake* is a title that was famously difficult for id Software to create, complete with several delays and an increasingly hostile work environment. After sustained conflict with head programmer John Carmack, John Romero was fired shortly after the game’s 1996 release.

The list of real-life *Quake* casualties is notorious. 

The list of virtual *Quake* casualties is endless. Every day, hundreds of thousands would play the new game with up to 16 competitors to a single server, up from 4 per server for *Doom*.

The game received towering reviews noting the stunning combat gameplay and the monumental technical achievement the game represented. For all of the love showered on id’s knack for single player experience, *Quake*’s multiplayer experience was revered head and shoulders above all else.

"In 1996 there wasn’t much of an internet," Level designer Tom Willits told 1UP.com. “*Doom* was a peer-to-peer system and a pain in the ass. *Quake* was the first true PC server/client architecture system. People told us we were crazy. They said, why would anyone run a *Quake* server on their machine to allow people they don’t know to play a game?”

Immediately, the already substantial online gaming community gave birth to the competitive community. News sites spawned quickly, teams and clans were formed, matches were organized, wins and losses were doled out as competitors played tirelessly into the dawn of modern esports. 

Although entering a server was initially a tedious manual task, *Quake* eventually gave rise to server browsers in the form of QuakeSpy that would eventually become GameSpy.

The term cyberathlete was coined around this time. 

Thresh was sponsored by Microsoft in 1996. Ambitious minds and active imaginations spawned grandiose ideas of a cybersports Super Bowl. 

The first QuakeCon took place in August 1996. In a Best Western in Garland, Texas, a group of young men filled up the hotel’s ballroom with massive gaming machines. Ready to play at the highest level they could, the group decided to invite the famous creators of the game to a deathmatch.

They wrote the challenge on a loose piece of paper and a dozen guys signed their names. They drove to the id Software offices with what read like a declaration of war.

"The ops of #quake cordially invite the guys at id to a MAN BEATING," read the note, according to Dungeons and Dreamers.

The #quake community from IRC organized what became the first QuakeCon and reached out to id to raise the event to the next level. Carmack and company made the trip to the event. The online community first heard the specifics of id’s arrival via "Redwood’s Quake Page", a popular Quake community site. When the community heard, they came to Texas from all over the United States and even attracted a few dedicated gamers from Canada.

The event reached up to 60 people by Friday, a much more crowded and competitive con than anyone was expecting. It grew from there. The room was filled with shouts and curses back and forth and players killed and died on screen. It was filled with community. The id guys arrived, played, entertained and supported the gamers in front of them. Id brought gear for prizes and, when the electricity charge was much higher than anyone expected, John Carmack wrote the group a check to cover the difference.

Meanwhile, players took to online leagues immediately as the competitive community burned brighter and brighter with each day.

In a 2005 interview with GotFrag.com, Sujoy Roy, an early professional *Quake* player, said, "Today [in 2005] online and tournament gaming is very organised and it's hard to get a shot at the top players. Back in 1996 it was more like the Wild West. Every player with some kind of reputation was out to protect it the hard way, by spending time on servers and getting their name to the top of the scoreboard."

"The internet gaming aspect [of *Quake*] was almost an accident," said John Carmack in a 2011 note on BethBlog.com. “I had moved from Doom’s peer-to-peer networking to client/server primarily to allow late game entry, and UDP was supported because I was still doing a lot of the development on NEXTSEP unix workstations. The idea of playing over the internet was always there, but I didn’t think it would be practical for many people due to the long latencies and variable performance of typical connections. When it turned out that people were doing it despite the low quality, it gave me the incentive to develop the alternative *QuakeWorld* executable with the various latency reduction mechanisms.”

*QuakeWorld* was id Software’s own mod dedicated to improving competitive play. Whereas multiplayer *Quake* was designed with low latency environments in mind (LANs), *QuakeWorld* was optimized for internet play with superior netcoding and a world-wide ranking system fueling the competitive fervor. It was an important step forward in a community where the vast majority of competition was taking place online.

More and more leagues started up, most notably and successfully at the time, ClanRing. Founded by a group of energetic but inexperienced amateurs, ClanRing grew from the chaotic scene into one of the most important institutions in competitive gaming of that time. ClanRing was the center of the online *Quake* world for a time.

"We were all getting our feet wet for the first time," said Will Bryan of ClanRing to MuppetClan.com, “and we knew there would be a few problems here and there as we learned to swim.”

The occasionally disorganized organization grew and learned from early missteps. Missed matches, latency issues, punctuality, server existence and then stability were hallmark problems of 90s competitive gaming. There was no easy button to compete, no automated matchmakers.  These players put in work to compete.

In an era when players’ internet connections varied from T1 to 28.8k modems (a range of 1.5mb/s to 28.8kb/s), it was impossible to ignore the consequential issues.

"Connections are the cruel nemesis of our Quaking existence," said the player Rigormortis of the successful Impulse 9 team in an interview on MuppetClan.com. Rigormortis went on to describe major ClanRing tournaments in 1997 where his team’s latency regularly varied from 80ms to 7,000ms ping, a wildly unstable range.

Nevertheless, a vibrant community was emerging as the technology struggled to keep up with the demand to compete.

Ignored girlfriends, "*Quake*-widows", were half-joked about at minor and major events alike. The word ‘sport’ was used effusively to describe the competitive nature of the game as well as a hopeful future. Excited fans sincerely, loudly wondered how long it would take for the Olympics to notice them.

QuakeNet, now the largest Internet Relay Chat (IRC) server around, was founded in 1997, providing a focal point for a growing community in need of cohesion.

The 1997 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) featured the zenith of Thresh’s competitive gaming star. The event’s Red Annihilation tournament would land him a prize to be remembered. John Carmack’s red Ferrari 328 GTS was parked smack in the middle of the tournament floor waiting for a winner.

From thousands of online competitors, 16 had made the cut to play at E3 including some of the biggest names in *Quake*. WhiteWolf, Cross, Pookie, Reptile, Unholy, Sho2, B2, Kenn, Tony Nusall, Gollum, Kiljoy, rom1, froggy and Ultra.p all showed up to play but eventually fell short. The finalists were Tom "Entropy" Kizmey and Dennis "Thresh" Fong. 

Thresh dominated Entropy in the finals by a score of 13-1, claiming the royal red car and the lasting fame that came with it. Additionally, GotFrag.com reports that Thresh won a $10,000 Haunted House *Doom* tournament at that same event, adding further to his bank account and his legend.

Angel Munoz, the founder of the Cyberathlete Professional League (CPL), later stated on GotFrag.com, "When John Carmack announced he was giving away his Ferrari as a prize for the winner of Red Annihilation, the concept for CPL was born."

ClanRing, the premiere competitive *Quake* community that had organized Red Annihilation, primarily played host to major team games (4v4). The American Thresh’s Death Row team (with B2, Unholy and Spear) won the year’s major tournament in California over another top American team, Unforgiven (consisting of Gollum, Batch, Thorn and Graphik).

QuakeCon grew in 1997 as well, offering an organized tournament for the first time. ‘RiX’ won the tournament and took home $3,000 in hardware. It would still be two years until id Software became directly involved and the event began to resemble the behemoth that QuakeCon is today but an estimated 650 attendees were proof positive that the convention was moving forward.

By the mid-1990s, the competitive gaming community had firmly established itself online.

*Doom* and *Quake* are two of the most important esports titles of all time, both contributing invaluable firsts to a growing scene and community as well as catalyzing competitive gaming forward toward uncharted territory, directly in front of the mainstream spotlight. The world was taking notice. 

"*Quake* may be the most influential game of all time," wrote Ryan Winterhalter at 1UP.com. “Not the best game, not the most innovative, but the most influential. Without it, the industry would be a very different place today. 

"It gave rise to many of aspects of modern gaming that we take for granted. Its developers, modders, and even the very code of the game itself are ubiquitous in the industry today. Id Software's 1996 FPS gave rise to 3D gaming, client/server online play, the most prolific mod scene in history, multiplayer clans, server browsers, esports, mouse-look as the PC control standard, Valve and dozens of other companies, and even 1UP's sister website, GameSpy. Without *Quake*, it's unlikely another game that featured the same suite of innovations would have come along. We would have had to wait for each of those things one at a time."

Soon, with a wildly different sort of video game, computer chair generals around the world would play and compete in the real time strategy (RTS) genre, destined to fill arenas around the world in a way that no other genre has ever matched.
