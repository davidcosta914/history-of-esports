# Chapter 37 - The CPL at fever pitch (2005)

After years of successful and increasingly prominent tournaments, the CPL was the king of Western esports into 2005. This was the year in which the CPL’s inaugural World Tour took the tournament around the world with a prize pool of $1,000,000 and a $500,000 prize pool at the grand finals in New York City aired on MTV Overdrive. 

The first game featured at the event was the CPL’s most lasting title, *Counter-Strike*. Next, instead of the gold standards for the duel-deathmatch genre such as *Quake 3* or *Unreal Tournament*, the CPL chose *Painkiller* as the one-on-one FPS headliner in 2005. *Quake* was perceived to be too old while *Unreal*’s developers were undergoing a change in publishers and could not guarantee support for the game through the year. 

Additionally, *Painkiller*’s developers stated that they would build the game and complementary software with a mind toward esports. Promised features included *Painkiller*TV and improved netcode. These features never saw the light of day.

Today, *Painkiller* stands as an example of a competition artificially propping a game up for competition. It is not nearly the worst example -- you’ll find those later on -- but it is worth noting.

For a moment in 2005, *Painkiller* was the premiere deathmatch title for CPL.

At the New York City finals, the two competitors set to face off were Johnathan "Fatal1ty" Wendel, likely the most accomplished Western professional gamer of all time, and Sander "Vo0" Kaasjager, the Dutch FPS guru and the most successful and celebrated *Painkiller* player ever.

*Painkiller*’s unique gameplay encouraged hyperaggression in a way that *Quake* and its ilk, the games that Fatal1ty had won his world championships in, simply did not. Vo0 excelled as a trailblazer in this game, winning ten medals at 2005 CPL World Tour stops across the world including five golds, earning $232,000 in prize money during the tour, taking five of seven matches against Fatal1ty through the year and winning numerous 2005 awards including a 2005 CPL MVP award.

The show began with the obligatory and thoroughly cheesy pregame introduction courtesy of MTV and Angel Munoz. The rivalry between Fatal1ty and Vo0 was billed as the biggest rivalry in computer gaming history, a predictably hyperbolic statement that ignored *Counter-Strike*, *StarCraft* and *Quake* among others but suitably hyped up those viewers with no knowledge of the aforementioned games and their histories.

Those two players, Fatal1ty and Vo0, whose rivalry at that point was of such a great intensity that it did not need to be exaggerated in the least, met in the grand finals in a bid to take home the $150,000 first place prize.

Entering the match, Fatal1ty did not just possess a losing record against the major favorite Vo0 but had also only just recently lost the semifinals against the Dutchman. Vo0, being the higher seed in the grand finals, chose a map on which he’d never lost. Vo0 was the presumed champion by a mile.

"Two and out was what we were all thinking," wrote Jason Bass and Lee Chen at GotFrag about the widely predicted Vo0 win.

Instead, Fatal1ty’s victory in New York City helped to secure his place as one of the greatest Western gamers of all time. After falling to 0-2 because of the semifinals loss, Fatal1ty played an extremely cerebral, defensive game against the notoriously aggressive Vo0. The American came back to take four straight wins in extremely convincing fashion, opening up leads of 20 or more kills. With the victory, Fatal1ty earned his fifth world championship.

2005 was one of the last great years of Fatal1ty’s storied career. In addition to the CPL World Tour win for $150,000, Wendel captured nine other major prizes in 2005. The following year, 2006, would see him succeed numerous times in *Quake 4* and earn significant prize money and sponsorship dollars there. In 2007, Fatal1ty put down the mouse and keyboard when he signed with the Championship Gaming Series as a spokesman. He is currently not competing.

Despite the predictable cheese that MTV and CPL chose to bring to the event, the very fact of MTV’s involvement and the overall attention paid to the event by press was viewed as a major accomplishment by many figures within the esports industry including, of course, Angel Munoz but also extending to journalists such as Lee Chen (then Managing Editor at GotFrag and now a Vice President at MLG), Jason Bass (then GotFrag’s Editor in Chief and now the Chief Operating Officer of Complexity Gaming) and beyond.

"The Grand Finals was not only a competition," wrote Chen and Bass, “it was a show. A show for a mainstream publication airing on the definitive lifestyle channel of the millennium.”

In a recap of the CPL World Tour finals, the two launched into a lofty look forward at how the move to MTV might in turn mean the mainstreaming of esports, the best way to lead the industry toward "legitimacy".

"Up until today, there have been a handful of people who could make a living at working in esports professionally," wrote the GotFrag duo. “The interest of lifestyle companies in this sport that we all love so much means that many, many of us might have the opportunity to ‘play hard, go pro’ or work in this industry at a level heretofore unrealized. We’re under the microscope today. The rest of the world is going to be looking at us in ways they never did before and it’s GOOD.”

With the gift of hindsight, it is easy to see that MTV was never going to be the ideal platform on which esports would become mainstream. MTV may have been the "definitive lifestyle channel" at some point in the relatively distant past but by 2005, that time had long since passed. Now, the channel is a mediocre creator of ephemeral programming, faddish television of the sort that no one in esports should grandly aspire to if they hope to create a sustainable industry instead of continuing the boom and bust cycle which we’ve endured thus far.

At the time of the CPL World Tour finals, in the midst of the new and dizzying heights that Western esports had reached, it was easy to get caught up in the excitement.

Moving forward, the level of excitement about the growth of esports grew toward a fever pitch. 

"In 2001, video and computer games out-grossed the movie industry in the US, raking in over $6 billion," wrote the GotFrag duo. “2005 ends on a landmark event that takes the ‘gaming’ industry into a culture a lifestyle all its own. 2006 may very well be more exciting than this year in many, many ways.”

Over several years in the 2000s, money began to flow into Western esports at an unprecedented rate. Numerous attempts were made to strike gold on television, to win a massive audience for esports from the enormous group already playing games.

Whether or not this influx of cash and attention would lead to sustained growth or a dangerous economic bubble waiting to burst would be a question too rarely asked as is all too often the case when the money is plentiful.
