# Chapter 44 - Brood War’s autumn (2005-2012)In the world of competitive gaming, StarCraft: Brood War belongs to an exclusive three-member club that includes its PC peers, the millenial esports trio: Brood War, Counter-Strike and Quake 3. These are three games that elevated esports to previously unseen levels of success from 1998 and into the future. Much of the infrastructure that esports enthusiasts enjoyed during the 00s and today was built on top of these games.That infrastructure was shaken furiously in 2008 by organizations such as the CGS combined with the great recession. However, enough solid brick and mortar remained in the form of healthy teams, player bases and organizations to build what we have now, something greater than anything we’ve seen in the past.In 2004, as they voted for the greatest player in esports history (Boxer won), ESReality.com (a Western FPS deathmatch centered site) described the Korean RTS scene in this way, contrasting it with the Western esports scene:“Which gaming scene has the most pro gamers? Which pro gamers put in the most time? Which pro gamers have wages and annual contracts? Which pro gamers are recognised when they walk down the street, and cause queues of autograph hunters to form? Which pro gamers appear on national TV, in the news, in commercials and in lifestyle shows?”StarCraft.Around the world, StarCraft’s continued success must be credited in large part to the game’s ability to shift, change and be reborn time and time again. Instead of rigor mortis setting in after the final balance patch in 2001, the game continued on as a living entity.StarCraft is packaged with a powerful customization tool allowing users to create maps and scenarios. When Blizzard ceased to offer balancing support, the community was able to take charge through this tool and balance the game on their own. For years, major Korean leagues were able to produce a constant stream of new and unique maps. The maps were created with the game’s current and future balance always in mind, forged in order to strengthen or weaken a certain aspect of play. The Korean map designers produced a better esport.Blizzard’s absence created a necessity for balance that had to be met through other avenues. In response to that need, the Koreans forged the most vibrant, prolific and successful custom map scene of all time. When the developer was nowhere to be found, the users proved far more adept at handling the game’s progress.While Counter-Strike and Quake have suffered numerous, varying blows that have shrunk their player base around the world (it must be said, CS still has a very significant competitive base), StarCraft maintained a strong base in South Korea through the entire decade. StarCraft players such as Boxer, Nada, Iloveoov, July, Savior and Bisu have been some of the most successful esports athletes in the world both in game and, in terms of financial and popular success, out of game.Ma Jae Yoon (Savior) was one of the greatest and most dominant StarCraft players of all time, winner four major championships from 2005 to 2007. He was known as “The Maestro” for the devastatingly artistic way in which he revolutionized StarCraft strategy. He became the first Zerg player of all time to rise to such great heights as to be called a “bonjwa”, a Korean word meaning a player who dominates the game for a long period of time.In some aspects (such as the Zerg vs. Terran matchup), Savior remains the greatest of all time. It is difficult to put into words, never mind a single word, the sort of competitor Savior was except to say that he reached a certain peak and form that is yet untouched by another Zerg as many as four years later.Teammates and friends such as Iloveoov have said that Savior soon tired of the game, that it was no longer fun and that he could no longer find meaning in the games played. Following a conspicuous slump in 2008 and 2009, Savior’s legacy was forever marred by the match-fixing scandal that ruined his career and highlighted the shortcomings of the Korean StarCraft world.Savior, who was among ten Korean professional players charged with a crime, became involved in a criminal betting ring and threw games for financial gain. He was eventually stripped of all titles and his pro gaming license. Savior was forced to retire and pay significant fines, was put on probation and was denigrated and brought low by the whole of the esports world. The scandal was of such importance that major international news outlets such as the BBC covered the story.“Once among the most loved of all champions, Savior now is loathed as a true villain,” wrote Ver for Team Liquid. “The tainting of his formerly great legacy happened almost overnight. Gone is the once overwhelming desire to see his return, being replaced by scorn and mocking. But the match fixing cannot override or disqualify the beauty and quality of Savior's play. Whatever actions he may have taken outside the game do not change what he did within it, for it. Savior is probably the most studied player in history, yet to this day almost everyone, even pros, do not realize the full extent of his discoveries.”Although the scandal did not come close to bringing the Korean StarCraft world to its knees as many initially feared, it did mar the industry and highlight once more the poor conditions that most Korean Brood War players endured to compete. Many in the West drew parallels to the 1919 Black Sox scandal in American baseball where players, some mistreated and underpaid and some not, threw the World Series in a conspiracy hatched by professional gamblers and criminals. The analogy does not hold for all the players charged - Savior was well paid, after all - but it is worth mentioning due to the poor treatment of so many StarCraft players over the years by draconian organizations such as the Korean eSports Association (KeSPA).Since the release of StarCraft 2 in 2010, we have entered into the twilight years of StarCraft 1. The sequel has established a new and growing fan base around the world and has become the most important global esport of 2010 and 2011. However, Brood War remains the chosen (if shrinking) game of South Korea and the two greatest players of this era remain two of the most respected in all of esports.Lee Jae Dong (Jaedong), was the next great Zerg, dubbed the “Heir Apparent” after the fall of Savior. Jaedong won Rookie of the Year in 2006 and, in 2008, claimed the Zerg throne (as measured by Elo rating) and has held it for two and a half years, a record.Jaedong came to be the most celebrated Zerg versus Zerg player of all time, building better than an 80% win rate when previously a 60% rate had seemed an exceptional event. Jaedong has become one of the best players of all time since his first appearance and has earned hundreds of thousands in prize money and guaranteed contracts.When he is at his best, Jaedong has displayed technical prowess worthy of being called masterful on a level that not only recalls Savior’s highest points but, in many situations, surpasses it.For the last few years, Jaedong’s greatest rival and, now, the consensus most skilled player of all time is Lee Young Ho (Flash).“He is the ultimate weapon,” wrote Tom Hackleman in The StarCraft Bible. “The term ‘ultimate’ justly describes his ability because as opposed to some machine that repeats an action over and over, Flash possesses the uncanny ability of adaptation and strategy. This master tactician has time and time again shown an unparalleled ability to analyze a given situation and determine the proper action that will be most devastating to his opponent. His immense ability to out-strategize an opponent is not limited to minor in-game alterations but expands to his large scale out-of-game strategizing.  Flash has been demonstrating his strategic prowess since his introduction into the professional scene, back in 2007.”The Flash versus Jaedong rivalry has endured for years. From 2008 on, the two have clashed time and time again in various stages of tournaments including numerous grand finals. Although Jaedong held the initial advantage, Flash has taken the decisive upper hand since 2010 and has been inaugurated as one of the greatest StarCraft players of all time in the process.In 2010, the two met in the finals of the most prestigious tournament in StarCraft, the OSL, held for the first time in Shanghai, China to mark the tournament’s ten year anniversary. Flash sought his third OSL win to catapult him into the territory that only StarCraft legends occupy. Just as important, he was in a position to capture both major individual Korean StarCraft tournaments (OSL and MSL) at the same time.“When the curtains rose [in China], the initially pessimistic outlook [for the first event held outside of Korea] was forgotten,” wrote Emlary on Team Liquid. “Yes, it could have been more magnificent if was held in a bigger venue like the famous People's Stadium which seats 80,000. However, from what I read in Chinese BW communities, most people enjoyed it nonetheless. Many spectators posted threads, photos, blogs and reports to describe how excited they were when they watched a live StarLeague final for the first time in their own country. More seats were given to fans instead of some officials who had no clue about video games or e-sports. Thousands of spectators also watched the final outside of the venue without tickets. Flash fans shouted out loud ‘Jiao Zhu’ (Flash's nickname among Chinese community, literally it means a cult leader) to cheer for him and his gold mouse.”In the first OSL final outside of Korea, Flash firmly established himself as the greatest player in the game. Whether or not he is a bonjwa like the greatest players before him was once a loud and acrimonious argument that has now lost its luster.“I once compared the concept of bonjwa to the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World,” wrote WaxAngel at Team Liquid. “It was an honorary title with no rhyme or reason to it, only related to fit a specific need at a certain period in time. People have and will continue to try and invoke it in the future but it will never have its original meaning or be recognized in the same way again. There’s no need to try to fit Flash into some ancient rubric. In the end, Flash will be Flash and he’s writing his own history.”
