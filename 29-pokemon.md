# CHapter 29 - Pokemon (1999-2008)

*Pokemon*, one of the most popular media franchises of all time, produced two competitive games. The *Pokemon *card game was an immediate international coup for Nintendo. Next, a new organized esport emerged in the *Pokemon* video game.

The competitive *Pokemon* video game is a turn-based fighting game in which the player chooses his *Pokemon* from over 650 different beasts, each possessing their own combat characteristics, and hopes to knock the opposing *Pokemon* out.

The *Pokemon* competitive community started in 1999 on a handful of video game forums. 

"Articuno64, the head admin of Smogon [now the largest competitive *Pokemon* site on the net] and myself both originate from the GameFAQs Pokemon forums," said competitive *Pokemon* player Danny "TTS" Zoller. 

Other popular *Pokemon* forums from the turn of the century, at the early stages of the *Pokemon* craze in the West, were ThePokeMasters, Pojo, PokeDaily and AzureHeights, a *Pokemon*-specific community created by some of the best players at the time and widely regarded as the best place to go for strategic discussion until somewhere around 2001-2002. 

"Until 2009 there was no real organized system of ‘official’ competitive play," wrote TTS. “There were a handful of tournaments prior to 2009, but they were small, badly organized, and not what anyone would consider real competitions. From 1999-2009 competitive Pokemon existed almost entirely as a casual thing between members of online communities.”

The games have always been based on handheld gaming systems such as Gameboy, Gameboy Advance and the Nintendo DS. However, prior to the *Pokemon* Diamond, Pearl and Platinum games (released in 2006 as opposed 1996’s *Pokemon* Red and Blue), the only way to play against someone was using the actual games (as opposed to a PC game emulator or battle simulator) required players to be in the same room using Nintendo’s link cables. The 2006 generation of *Pokemon* games (known as DPP) introduced online play using the Nintendo DS’s online capabilities.

"Before DPP, the community actually created computer-based simulators for each version of the game as they were released," said TTS. “These simulators allowed us to play against each other using the mechanics from the games back when consoles having online access was still 6-8 years away. Simulators are 100% responsible for the competitive Pokemon community being what it is today, and even with the advent of online play they are still the preferred method of play for most people.”

The first simulator from the late 90s was browser-based, buggy and did not go so far as to implement all *Pokemon*. In this era of *Pokemon*, the community was an incomplete jigsaw puzzle, a mish-mash of various forums. Interforum feuds and the tournaments in which the best of each major forum would battle were the height of the era’s competitive scene.

In addition to forums, IRC channels became major hubs and facilitated competitive play in much the same way that they did for *Quake* and *Counter-Strike*.

In 2000, Nintendo hosted a tournament consisting of four regional stops with an attendance cap of 32 people each.

"The winner of each of these 4 stops was flown somewhere for the ‘US Nationals’," wrote TTS. “The winner of that 4 man nationals tournament was Ian Garvey, who was sent to Sydney, Australia along with winners from Britain, Germany, and Japan so that the Pokemon ‘World Championships’ consisting of 4 players, could be held coinciding with the 2000 Summer Olympics.”

Darryn Van Vurren of the UK won the tournament according to Gamespot.com.

Over the course of several years, various simulation programs were written for the competitive community. The programs varied from little more than glorified spreadsheets to fully fleshed out graphical experiences.

"Somewhere around 18-24 months after the GSBots were released, the second simulator for the second generation was released known as Netbattle," wrote TTS. “This was an actual computer program, coded in either VB7 or C++  and as such had a full GUI, graphics, sounds, the works. Initially the community that used Netbattle was considered to be of a lower caliber skill-wise, which led to a slightly slow adoption speed, but within a year the bugs that Netbattle had were mostly worked out and the community almost fully switched over to it.”

The middle of the decade, 2005, saw the founding of Smogon.com, the single largest competitive *Pokemon* website.

In 2005 and 2006, Nintendo continued holding a select few major tournaments. 

"Journey Across America" (JAA) was 2006’s competition. At least a 16-location mall-tour around the nation, it remains the most expansive *Pokemon* tournament to date if measured by sheer number of locations. 

JAA also began the tradition of doubles (two *Pokemon* versus two) becoming the standard for Nintendo tournaments. Doubles make the game move exponentially faster

"[The doubles format] is hugely advantageous for holding tournaments because the matches move exponentially faster than they do otherwise," wrote TTS. “Just one ‘single’ battle with one *Pokemon* out on each side can easily go on for an hour or more, whereas double battles rarely go past 15-20 minutes.”

The 2006 national finals were held in Bryant Park in New York City.

Despite JAA’s success and aside from the few tournaments, Nintendo had for years played a hands-off role in regard to the competitive community. Nintendo’s lack of interaction and acceptance of the competitive play has long been a point of contention with *Pokemon* fans.

"The fact is that we’ve had to deal with years and years of Nintendo basically ignoring the existence of legitimate competitive play," wrote Kristoph on the Smogon.com forums, “both in that they’ve provided little ‘support’ for any sort of actual scene and in that they just plain fuck around with the balance however they damn well please (probably a bigger deal to be honest).”

Into 2008, when considering how enormous the franchise is in total, the *Pokemon* competitive community remained relatively neglected, receiving only a few official tournaments and sporadic official support.

They played anyway.
