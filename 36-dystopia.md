# Chapter 36 - Dystopia (2005)Many smaller games have communities supporting esports scenes. A number have and will be highlighted, as they are emblematic of smaller esports communities everywhere in many significant ways.The mod scene for 2004’s Half-Life 2 was extremely productive, just as its predecessor’s notoriously successful mod scene had been.Dystopia, a 2005 class-based team shooter, was a Source engine mod based on Half-Life 2. Small but passionate competitions such as the Dystopia Global League were the foundations of the organized competitive scene.The game of Dystopia is atypically complex for an esport. It has various classes, customizations, weapons and mechanisms such as turrets much like Team Fortess 2, itself a Source engine mod.Adding to that, the game also has an entire secondary world, cyberspace, in which you battle with totally separate rules and from which you affect the “real” and physical first world.“It was pretty tiny, maybe 20 clans at its peak, but it was a lot of fun,” wrote solomute on reddit.com/r/esports.Dystopia was the center of a small, tightly knit community.The production value for events from communities of this size is always iffy. Commonly, the content producers are simply a couple of passionate fans with no formal training or real clue as to what they ought to do with the hardware (such as microphones) and software (such as video editing programs) they have in front of them.However, despite the many problems inherent with these sorts of projects, they never fail to provide unique and interesting content from which passion positively oozes. This has been true across dozens of relatively minor competitive titles over the years and remains true today.
