# Chapter 52 - StarCraft 2 (2007-2012)

From the moment the development of *StarCraft 2* was announced in 2007, the global *StarCraft* community stirred and began to grow. The once shrinking and slouching international scene did a complete about-face, rapidly coming to attention as players and money raised the global *Brood War* scene to heights not seen since the beginning of the 2000s.

By late 2009, TeamLiquid.net (the largest Western *SC1* and *SC2* community site) was running the Team Liquid StarLeague with over $20,000 in prizes that was streamed to tens of thousands of fans live. 

By the time the *StarCraft 2*’s beta launched in early 2010, international *Brood War* had undergone a genuine renaissance. What was a small group in which many of the members were personally familiar with each other in 2005 became the largest, most active and most successful esports community in the West by 2010. 

*Brood War* had long since earned a global reputation as the most successful esport of all time. When the sequel was around the corner and many other esports (see: *Warcraft 3*, *Quake*, et al.) shrunk considerably, fans looked excitedly to the older game’s global success and to the new game’s obvious potential. 

The community and industry that had sustained *Brood War* around the world was poised to aggressively expand. Top international players, most of whom had never been able to play and be paid at the top level in South Korea, were now in prime positions to transform their passions into professions, to see their talent pay major dividends.

In Korea, most top *Brood War* players would not make the immediate switch. Salaried *Brood War* pay dwarfed *StarCraft 2* pay for the vast majority of 2010 and 2011. In Korea in particular, *StarCraft 2* teams were on extremely tenuous financial ground compared to Western *SC2 *teams and Korean *BW* teams. Despite their in-game success, Korean *StarCraft 2* teams were largely unable to match the sponsorships and financial sure-footedness that Western teams achieved. 

This can be attributed to a number of factors, most prominently that *StarCraft 2* is simply much more successful (in terms of popularity as well as almost any other measurement) in the West than it is in Korea.

By the autumn of 2010, just months after its retail release, overall prize money in *StarCraft 2* had already surpassed its older brother’s offerings. However, potential international prize money alone was simply not enough to tempt stars such as Jaedong and Flash from their six figure salaries - not yet, anyway. Even in 2011, those two are making more in salary than any *StarCraft 2* player. As of 2012, rumors are running rampant that many top Korean *Brood War* players and organizations will be making the switch to the more popular sequel.

As soon as the game was playable, *StarCraft 2* was played on a serious competitive level. Online tournaments began in earnest in just days. Once the retail version was released, major offline tournaments took place immediately. ESL’s Intel Extreme Masters (IEM), Korea’s Global *StarCraft* League (GSL) and the United States’ Major League Gaming (MLG) were among the first major firms entering the booming *StarCraft 2* business.

Almost immediately, *StarCraft 2* became the most visible esport in the world. Growing from highs of 50,000 concurrent viewers at early major tournaments in 2010, *StarCraft 2* has reached heights near 200,000 at MLG. Internationally, players such as Evil Genius’ Chris "HuK" Loranger are earning low six figure salaries in addition to prize money won (which, in Huk’s case, amounts to over $60,000).

For publishers such as Blizzard, one of the great challenges of esport’s growth is figuring out how to monetize their game’s competitive side. Blizzard has taken a much more proactive role with *StarCraft 2*. 

Blizzard’s remains frustrated with the lack of monetization of their mammoth esport *Brood War*, a game that made consistent money for thousands in Korea but did not provide an enduring source of revenue for Blizzard.

Blizzard established more advantageous licensing guidelines for major *StarCraft 2* competitions. Although the agreements between Blizzard and major leagues vary and, for the most part, are not revealed, it is clear that Blizzard takes a percentage of profit from major competitions (major being defined roughly by a prize pool of over $5,000). 

Blizzard has cooperated closely with leagues such as GSL and MLG over issues such as licensing, in-game balance and promotion to the wider gaming world. It is extremely common to see Blizzard staffers at major events to observe and work with the organizers in question. 

Blizzard’s support has fallen short of fan’s hope in many respects. Publishers such as Riot (*LoL*), S2 (*HoN*) and Valve (*CS*, *Dota 2*) have raised the bar by highlighting competitive streams inside of game clients and thereby pushing viewership of major events up from tens of thousands into the six figure range. These publishers have also all invested considerable sums (over $1 million for Valve’s *Dota 2* Invitational) into prize pools and competitive events in order to increase the visibility of their game. 

As *LoL* competitions compete with and regularly surpass *StarCraft 2* tournaments in terms of visibility, questions have arisen as to why Blizzard has not worked harder to promote their competitive scene. Blizzard has stated that in-client streaming may be on the docket for 2012.

By any measure, the most successful *StarCraft 2* player of all time is Jeong "Mvp" Jong Hyeon.

Formerly a young *Brood War* player on a solidly upward trajectory, Mvp has come to win over $250,000 in prize money in *StarCraft 2*. The vast majority of that money was won as he rose to primacy in 2011.

Mvp’s switch to *StarCraft 2* was in many respects a gamble with his career and his life. After being raised in a poor family, the massive monetary rewards that *StarCraft 2* offered proved too great a temptation to resist. Despite his solid results and promising future in *Brood War* (Mvp took games off of players such as Flash), Mvp switched the new game and aimed for the massive prize pool of the GSL. 

By January 2011, Mvp won GSL’s Code S, dominating what is easily the most prestigious league on the planet by dropping only a single set in the grand finals to teammate and rival NesTea. Mvp earned the $44,480 first place prize for his efforts.

By August 2011, Mvp had long been recognized as the greatest player on the planet. His performance in that month’s vaunted GSL Code S rendered the fact inarguable. After beating MC, Polt, NesTea, July, Huk and TOP all in utterly thorough victories, Mvp claimed another trophy and another giant $44,480 check. 

In his wake, Mvp left the most difficult GSL path in history bloodied and beaten. In MC, Polt and Nestea, Mvp beat three GSL champions. In Huk, he beat one of the greatest international players in the world and a DreamHack champion. In July, Mvp beat a legendary *Brood War* Golden Mouse winner. It was only in the grand finals against TOP, a talented but underperforming Terran player in his own right, that Mvp finally faced off against a player who had never won a major championship. Mvp won easily 4-1.

In the biggest game of the biggest year in esports history, Mvp was alone in dominance. In 2011, Mvp has won three GSL Code S championships, the MLG Anaheim gold medal, the BlizzCon championship and a WCG gold medal.

*StarCraft 2*’s greatest growth has been in the Western world. In particular, Major League Gaming (full disclosure: I worked for MLG for several months in 2011) has seen growth that has launched it into the spotlight of the mainstream media. The company had previously supported titles such as *Halo* and *Call of Duty*. By 2010, the company was shrinking. Even in 2011, it is dependent on tens of millions of dollars in venture capital and is not profitable.

MLG reported record viewership throughout 2011. With no third party, MLG themselves has reported that the peak viewership for the 2011 national championships in Providence was over 240,000. 3.6 million hours of videos were reportedly consumed during the event, pushing the championships to rival American cable channels.

MLG was featured on American cable television in the middle of the decade when *Halo* was its game of choice. The plan failed due to poor planning and then low viewership among other reasons. Throughout 2011, CEO Sundance DiGiovanni has overtly hinted at his desire to return to television, even dropping names such as ESPN in vague hype messages on Twitter. The network is reportedly ‘interested’ in the MLG, a term that is used no doubt for its exciting but vague implications.

The merits of television have been heavily debated. Since the CGS and MLG failed on television, many figures in the esports community remain wary of new TV ventures. The CGS and MLG are seen as prime examples of "too much too soon", an artificial burst that helped create the esports bubble which burst in 2008 and damaged the industry significantly, driving off not only corporate sponsors but thousands of individuals as well.

As the esports world drives into 2012, the fate of *StarCraft 2* is a hot topic.

Will the biggest esport on the planet be able to sustain its unparalleled growth?

In Korea, whispers about a massive *Brood War* switch to *StarCraft 2* are rampant. The old guard - KeSPA, OGN, the Proleague - are inching closer to the sequel.

In the West, other questions arise.

If MLG was unable to make a profit in 2011, the biggest year in esports history, what does that mean for the sustainability of its business model? MLG is the biggest and most successful *StarCraft 2* tournament on the planet. If it can’t survive, what are the implications the scene as a whole?

The year 2012 may not bring the end of the world but it is going to be a proving ground for the business of major esports. Near the front of the line to be tested is *StarCraft 2*.
