# Chapter 28 - The Fighting Game Community (1991-2000s)Rod Breslau (Slasher), an esports journalist, spoke with G4TV’s Leah Jackson in 2011 about the emergence of modern esports.“The legacy of competitive gaming and esports dates back to the late 90s, where three separate isolated incidents caused their communities to reach new heights and set the path to where we are today,” said Slasher.Breslau named these three moments: Thresh’s 1997 win which scored him John Carmack’s Ferrari, Grrr...’s 2000 trip to Korea where he became the only non-Korean to ever win a Starleague and Daigo Umehara’s first trip to America in 1998 to defeat Alex Valle “in Street Fighter Alpha 3, marking the first ever U.S. vs Japan battle and the start of Japan's dominance.”In an esports hall of fame, competitors such as Tomo, Thresh, Grrrr..., BoxeR and Fatal1ty would reside in the highest halls. Among their neighbors would surely be the Japanese fighter Daigo Umehara. Daigo, also known as The Beast and The King of Fighters, is the most successful fighting game player of all time and one of the most prominent and respected names in the entire esports community.At 10 years old in 1991, Daigo began stalking crowded and competitive Japanese arcades with the releases of Street Fighter 2 and Fatal Fury. He was often the youngest player in the arcades by far but immediately bonded with his older compatriots over the unique experience of fighting games.“Everyone else was older than me,” said Daigo to EuroGamer.net “and I enjoyed talking to [them] and learning different perspectives. A Japanese arcade is such a special place for me. It provided a community to interact with others that I would not have dealt with otherwise and an opportunity to learn from them.”For Umehara, the arcade quickly became his life. By his teenage years, he was spending hundreds of dollars per month at the arcade as he trained for hours on end. His old friends, the non-gamers, retreated into the background as the entirety of the arcade world advanced. With the exception of school and family, fighting games were Daigo’s whole world.“I played and played video games in my teens,” Daigo told Capcom-Unity.com. “I lost myself in games. I felt guilty at the same time, feeling pressured from the social norms, but I could not stop playing it. I struggled dealing with my passion and what was expected.“As I started to win many games, people started to notice me, but I hated when people told me that I was good, just so easily. I felt like it was just too easy for them to say not knowing how deeply I loved playing games. That’s how much I loved it. I could not even express how much I loved it. It was a part of me.”By 1997, Daigo was the Japanese Street Fighter national champion. At this point, there was still little interaction between the Japanese and American fighting scenes. As was the case when Tomo Ohira reigned only a few years earlier, each scene remained something of a question mark to the other. Major international tournaments had not been firmly established and the actual competition between the two continents was extremely limited.Capcom’s 1998 Street Fighter Alpha 3 world championship marked the beginning of an era in which the two scenes finally directly competed with one another. Daigo’s victory in that year’s Japanese championship earned him an invitation to play the American champion, Alex Valle, in Daigo’s first trip overseas.Valle had been a major figure in the fighting game community since 1996 when he fought John Choi at B3: Battle By The Bay, the predecessor to Evo and the unofficial west coast Street Fighter Alpha 2 arcade grand championship during that time.By the time Daigo arrived on American shores to play against Valle, their stars had risen to the point where this was the most highly anticipated match in fighting game history."The match against Alex Valle was my first time outside of Japan," said Umehara to EuroGamer.net. "Even though I had no idea about the skill level of US players, I sensed that Japanese players would be stronger. For some reason I was confident that I would win, even though I had no solid base for my assumption. I hadn't met any strong foreigners among those who I ran into time to time, and the US joysticks I had seen looked awful, thick at the top and tapered off at the bottom. They just seemed to lack finesse or precision. It was just my hunch that opponents who used such bad sticks could not be better than me.”Daigo’s (playing V-Akuma) 2-1 victory over Valle (playing V-Ryu) was a closely fought match. First Umehara won, then Valle and finally Umehara took the decisive match. In the end, the closeness of the fight did not contradict Daigo’s point about Japanese superiority.Writing about the match years later, Valle described his defeat in detail.“If you’ve seen the finals between Daigo and I, I out-footsied him the entire time playing ultra aggressive (zone pushing him with a VC [variable combo] ready),” wrote the American. “But this style has a weakness which he started to see like the beast he is. He started to see openings and repetitiveness. So, basically it was open season for his full screen VC’s during resets or teleporting. Now, to figure out that much defense during an international match - I don’t care who you are - that’s what we call CLUTCH. He exploited my openings and started to freestyle with random teleports in corner/roll DP or HK. Daigo won respectively [sic].”Earlier in the tournament, both players watched the other’s games to pick up on any tendencies and weaknesses they could find. Knowing this, both players also held back early on in hopes of surprising their presumed championship opponent. When matched up against each other in the finals, the players unveiled moves, mix-ups and styles of play that the other had not yet seen. Keeping in mind that neither player had had significant interaction with players outside of their home country, the newness of their opponent’s play to their eyes was profound.Valle’s defeat and Daigo’s victory set the stage and the tone for international competition from there. At 16, the young Japanese phenom was uniquely dedicated to fighting games. With his win over Valle, Daigo was the undisputed world champion and a growing celebrity both in the fighting scene and outside of it. His victories received coverage on Japanese television and laid the foundations for a reign atop fighting games that has lasted over than a decade.The fighting game community encompasses an entire genre and many different games in a way that no other esports community does. Daigo alone has competed at the highest levels in over a dozen titles from Vampire Hunter to Street Fighter 4.Most communities are centered around a specific title and even games as similar as StarCraft and Warcraft (both RTS titles made by the same company and with many of the same underlying mechanics) tend to maintain at least some distance between their competitive communities.On the other hand, the fighting game community adopts new games at a relatively rapid pace.There are several notable exceptions to that rule such as Super Smash Bros. and Soul Calibur to some extent, competitive communities that have remained distinct from the “traditional” FGC centered on communities such as Shoryuken.“Each game requires different skills and strategies to win but there are some universal formulas across fighting games” said Daigo to Capcom-Unity.com. “I get to discover that formula while playing fighting games. I really enjoy the moment of discovery and it makes me really happy. The excitement, the idea that I'll be able to find a brand new formula that can be applied throughout fighting games is what has kept me going for over a decade. I've never gotten tired of playing fighting games.”“Umehara's fame and reputation has spread through the fighting game community and beyond,” wrote Simon Parkin at EuroGamer.net. “He plays with unrivalled precision and grace, combining the reactions of a peak-form Muhammad Ali with the strategy of a Garry Kasparov. He is undoubtedly the greatest Street Fighter player to have played the game.”Fighting games share a great deal with other esports. Like StarCraft and Quake, speed plays a significant role. All three of these games may at first seem to be simply button-mashing competitions, more a question of who has the faster fingers than who possesses any significant skill. However, the best of these competitive games hold far greater depth than a cursory glance might suggest. In the middle of the rapid tactical maneuvers that characterize the most successful esports, these games become battles of wits wherein the ability to read and manipulate an opponent is a far greater skill to possess than any strength and speed of digits.Daigo has long credited much of his success to his ability to see meaning where others do not. Umehara says that a great player must be able to quickly recognize his opponent, what sort of person and player he is, what his thinking process entails and how that will affect him in a game. Daigo says he readily and repeatedly asks ‘why?’ Why would a player do this or that at a specific moment? He is rewarded for his curiosity with insight that allows him to consistently be several moves ahead of rivals.In an era before YouTube and Twitch TV made it easy to watch and study the best players alive, gamers such as Daigo, Alex Valle and Mike Watson were in uncharted territory.“I’d run into new stuff all the time,” said Alex Valle, “and that whole falling in love [and] learning Street Fighter phase: that was just so competitive for me. I got used to it. If I see something new, I think back like, ‘Ok, wow this is why I keep playing Street Fighter’. There’s something to adapt to.”"Almost instantly, [Alex] Valle understands your game, and from there he gets inside your head and just violates you," said Seth Killian, a major community figure at Capcom, in an interview with Kotaku.Daigo’s move from world champion to genuine international celebrity was catalyzedby his 2004 victory over Justin Wong, one of the most successful American players of the 2000s, at that year’s Evolution Championship Series (also known as Evo) event, the most popular fighting game competition in the world.Competing in Street Fighter 3: 3rd Strike, a game in which he professed to lack some confidence in playing, Daigo was a single hit away from being eliminated from the tournament by Wong.In a stunning display, Daigo parried fifteen attacks from Wong in rapid succession and countered with his own combo and super to win the match. The electricity of the maneuvers is exceeded only by the reaction of the crowd, an ecstatic and screaming group simply beside themselves. Meanwhile, Daigo himself was calm, incapable of appreciating the gravity of the situation even as the room was shaking around him from the screams of fans.Videos of the match have been seen millions of times. Daigo has said that he barely remembers the actual fight and only grasped the full situation when he later viewed the video and witnessed the crowd’s reaction. The game, the play and the crowd are all testament to the great esports value that fighting games have, taking a substantial mental and emotional investment from every player and fan it touches and repaying it in spades.The American publication GamePro has compared the 2004 Daigo/Wong moment to Willie Mays’ famous over-the-shoulder catch in the 1954 World Series, a spectacular act that has come to define more than simply a game but an entire moment in time. Obvious hyperbole aside, there is truth to the analogy.“[Capcom’s Seth Killian recently said that the 2004 Daigo versus Justin video has been viewed] in the 20+ million range, making it the most-watched competitive gaming moment of all time,” wrote Slasher for the mainstream gaming blog Kotaku. “This match, and one 37-second moment, seems to capture the core essence and emotion of what we all feel about competitive gaming in the scene's community.”The famous Daigo/Wong comeback took place at Evo 2004.The Evolution Championship Series traces its roots back to a 1995 40-man Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo tournament in California dubbed “Battle by the Bay”, the series in which Alex Valle and other American titans of the game first made their name. Although the specific games, name and location have changed (Evo is now held in Las Vegas), the soul of the thing remains the same.Gamespot described the 2004 Evo tournament in this way:“Approximately 700 participants from over 30 nations are competing. The prize pot for this event might not be as huge as other sponsored ‘professional gamer’ events, but the tournament and its organizers have a very long history of hosting some of the end-all-be-all matches in the Street Fighter community--and in the end bragging rights tend to be more important here than the monetary rewards.”Evolution 2004 was home to another major event in fighting game history. Prior to that year, arcade hardware was used to play tournament games. That year saw the adoption of console versions of tournament games. It was the biggest controversy of the year, seen as a break with tradition and a “cheapening of the entire experience,” wrote Stephen Kleckner at Gamespot.The switch from arcades to consoles had significant consequences in the games themselves as well as in the hearts and minds of the gamers.Competitive fighting games saw their start on arcades.Arcades are big machines, monsters of a size and weight reminiscent of the giant mainframe computers of old. Likewise, they were limited to commercial and academic settings such as gaming arcades and universities rather than personal settings such as the home and office. The 70s and 80s saw the rise of arcades, the late 80s saw a significant decline and the 90s saw a fiery rebirth. The late 90s saw the final collapse of arcades.Just as the fighting game community began building up a truly international scene, the arcade industry sputtered. Prohibitively high hardware prices led to a smaller player base. A smaller player base led to a rise in the cost to play the game. Higher costs per play meant a further shrinking player base. Arcades closed their doors and the player base became even smaller still. A competitive scene can survive but not thrive on a small and shrinking population. The competitive fighting game scene stagnated at the turn of the millennium and it would take the proliferation of another sort of machine to restart its growth.Home consoles have existed since Home Pong. Through Nintendo’s arrival and beyond, they gained immense market share in the gaming world. In the 90s, the low cost and high quality of consoles snuffed the final life out of arcades and its competitive scene.Consoles are different sorts of beasts. Instead of living in an arcade, a social world inhabited by an army of potential gamers, consoles live in the home and have by their nature a limited number of users. Although fighting games had been ported to consoles for years, the environment that had given rise to the competitive scene largely ceased to exist in the late 90s.It took the rise of the internet and then the adoption of it by consoles to adequately support the growth of competitive console gaming.In 1995, the Xband was released. The Xband was a modem that allowed players to connect and compete over a network for a fee, much like the similar products that had been seen in the PC world years earlier. Although it was available for the Sega Genesis and Super Nintendo, its success was extremely limited and it met an unceremonious end in 1997 with the release of the next generation of consoles.The next generation included the Sony PlayStation and the Nintendo 64. This round of consoles introduced first person shooters from the PC world to the console world, the genre that would become the dominant competitive platform on consoles.A 2005 article from Major League Gaming briefly explored the relationship between PC and console competitive gaming.“PC gamers have always had the first crack at new technology, which has allowed them to enjoy advances in competitive gaming before the major consoles,” wrote the unspecified MLG author. “PCs have always been able to make immediate use of any new technology due to their customizability which as kept them a step ahead of the [console] game.”Consoles, on the other hand, were consistently cheaper and simpler, adopted by millions of gamers around the world.The console world finally entered the internet age in 1999 when the Sega Dreamcast became the first console to ship with a modem, introducing millions to the world of online gaming and opening them to the idea of competitive gaming.Due to the generally closed nature of the software and hardware, it takes a concerted (but not intentional) effort from the manufacturer of the consoles and the games to create an environment in which competitive gaming can thrive. PlayStation 2 and then the Xbox (and their respective sequels) took giant strides in this area for console gamers. Tools such as stat tracking, matchmaking, dedicated servers and spectating had existed on PCs for years but did not enter the console world in force until well into the 2000s.In 2004, arcades presented a number of major downsides. For instance, an arcade would cost as much as a car. Meanwhile, consoles brought several new advantages to the table. Evo 2004 decided to make the controversial switch to consoles.“First of all, it has proven difficult to pull together enough arcade equipment to run all nine featured games,” continued Stephen Kleckner. “Back when the Shoryuken staff [who administer Evolution] used to run Capcom games exclusively, CPS-2 hardware was still the platform of choice for the latest games, and admittedly it was an easier-than-usual platform to get a hold of (throw a rock into a crowd consisting of regular Efnet #capcom idlers on IRC, and 7 out of 10 times you'll probably hit someone who owns a CPS-2 setup). This has changed with today's list of titles. While Super Street Fighter II Turbo is easy enough to get a hold of (being CPS-2), everything else is on completely different and expensive platforms.”Arcades also offer common technical difficulties that consoles do not. Sticks and buttons break often and are much more challenging to fix than their easily replaced console counterparts, requiring a trained technician to be on call. Replacing an arcade stick requires at least 15 minutes versus 15 seconds for a console stick.“There is also the ‘excuse’ factor,” wrote Kleckner. “Legitimate or not, because arcade hardware relied on using only one style of control panel, there was a whole lot of room for excuses and accusations. It was not uncommon to overhear someone complain about the button layout being different, or the buttons not being the same style as they are in another part of the country, or the sticks being of one particular brand rather than another in the loser's bracket. Although preparations were made to accommodate the Japanese players by hooking up a Japanese cabinet, it was impossible to accommodate every other control panel style.”The fix, according to the tournament staff, was to switch to consoles and allow players to bring their own custom, replaceable sticks, to play their preferred console version of the game.Players would have “no one to blame but themselves when they lose. It is a win-win situation,” concluded Kleckner.What would become Evo was founded in 1996 by Tom Cannon (Inkblot) “to settle an online argument over which part of California had the best Street Fighter players.” Shoryuken.com, the major Western fighting game community, was founded in 1999 by Inkblot as a crash course in PHP. Today, Evo and SRK (as Shoryuken is known) are the cornerstones of the fighting game community (FGC) in the Western world.In stark contrast to most other major gaming tournaments, Evo is seen as a community-run event. In this, Evo is unique when its large size is taken into account. Its Japanese counterpart, Tougeki or Super Battle Opera (SBO), is run by Japanese gaming magazine Arcadia. Even Japanese players effusively compliment the American competition.When asked which major competition he preferred, The King of Fighters immediately answered Evo.“EVO gives every player a fair chance and every player can have fun playing and leave with satisfaction,” said Daigo. “We all can show the result of days and hours of our hard work. Even if you lose, you can admit your loss and leave content. And the prize is bigger! That certainly helps too. All in all, EVO is kind to all fighting players. EVO is dedicated for us, and that's why I love EVO.”
