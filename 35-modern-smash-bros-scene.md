# Chapter 35 - The modern Smash Bros. scene (2002-2012)In 2002, the first Smash Back Room was created on Smashboards.com. Back then, it was a place for prominent members of the community to chat with friends in private rather than public. Many competitive gaming websites have similarly “semi-secret” forums that cater to community veterans but are hidden from view of the average visitor.The Smashboards Back Room grew from a simple privileged forum to a more potent force when M3D, the head of MLG’s Smash operations, added significant and knowledgable players and tournament operators in the forum.“From this effort, it became a union of TOs [tournament organizers] that shared stories.  The secrecy was kept intact so TOs could discuss specific issues that they had at tournaments without worrying about it coming out. [TOs] discussed their perspective on rules, tournament results and characters which periodically produced and updated a tier list,” wrote MLG_JV.A tier list is a common feature of most major fighting game communities. In the Back Room’s case, they produce an authoritative ranking of all in-game characters in order of their potential to win under tournament conditions. The sheer knowledge and influence of the Back Room members made the list an important part of the community.In 2007, the Back Room effectively became a governing body, making decisions for all of competitive Smash. That year, the group released the National Ruleset, a project headed by AlphaZealot.“Later in 2010 and early 2011, the Unity Ruleset Committee [URC] formed,” wrote AlphaZealot. “This was a room and group just for Tournament Organizers [TO] who worked together and ran the same ruleset. Before this group formed of the 500+ tournaments held a year in Smash, few if any ever ran the same ruleset. Within months of this group forming and releasing their ruleset, over half of all tournaments (and sometimes much higher percents in a weekend) were using the same ruleset.“This is an innovative idea never before seen in any other community, since many communities rely on a single entity to guide their ruleset. StarCraft is an exception because of multiple competing large scale tournaments, resulting in about half a dozen, maybe more, map pools, but even 5-10 ruleset variations is small compared to the 30+ in Brawl before the URC came around.”“Since then, the community has looked to the Back Room exclusively for judgements about controversial issues, whether it’s support or ridicule,” wrote MLG_JV. “I opposed the National Ruleset project and I’m not a fan of closed-door decision making in the way that it has occured since.”“The question about the Brawl Backroom and Melee Backroom usually has to do with secrecy,” wrote AlphaZealot. “Why are they secret? I think part of it is simply because that is always how it has been. Another part is that it allows people to speak freely, like you would with a close circle of friends. The URC has slightly different motives since the TO’s may wind out negotiating with each other since they are running physical events. Them aside, the Backrooms could probably be opened up to at least public viewing, and it is issue that comes up each year.“Is it the best route? I think ultimately I’d like to see Brawl Backroom and Melee backroom discussion published and put out publicly after-the-fact so people can at least gleam the valuable information. I also worry and have become more worried in the last year that the existence of the backrooms has created a brain drain at Smashboards, causing the “best and brightest” posters to no longer contribute publically but instead privately.”The existence of an exclusive and secretive group of movers and shakers in a “back room” playing government over a competitive scene is, as far as I’ve seen it, a phenomenon almost exclusive to the Smash world.In Brood War, KeSPA (the Korean e-Sports Association) has yielded an enormous amount of power and influence over the Korean Brood War industry (as well as dozens of other games in South Korea).However, KeSPA was established with the approval of the Korean government to regulate everything from in-game rules to broadcasting rights to pro gaming licenses.In contrast, the Smash Back Room grew simply from a private group of influential people into a private congress writing legislation for the scene. There has never been anything quite like it in esports.The power is not unlimited, of course, and no one is bound to follow their rules.The Back Room recently banned the character MetaKnight, thus taking action on a very controversial issue.“The URC has banned the character at events, whether everyone follow suite or whether it fractures the community remains to be seen (it only took full effect on January 9th, 2012),” wrote AlphaZealot. “If it fractures I’m not sure what will happen, almost like a Smash civil war. It could lead to bigger and better things if one side finally wins out or it may lower interest in the game. This isn’t the first time this has happened though. Going back to 2003, we had a huge debate on items and briefly the community was fractured. After items were banned at the largest national of the time, TG6, everyone followed and the community grew by leaps and bounds.”As previously noted, almost all other communities do run private boards for influential figures. However, none wield the sort of power that the Back Room does.From 2008 to 2009, major Smash competitions doled out about $440,000 in prizes, charged over $500,000 in entrance fees and boasted over 25,000 participants. For that very active year, there were, on average, over two Smash tournaments per day.The increasingly organized and continuously active Smash scene was picked up again in 2010 by MLG, a year and a half after the league acquired Smashboards. The 2010 Pro Circuit distributed over $70,000 in prizes to the winners including the largest first prize ever of $12,500 for the national champions.Smash’s stay at MLG was short lived. Now, Smash has adapted completely to a competitive circuit of varying independent events throughout the country.“The community has rebounded nicely [from MLG dropping the game] both times though, with Melee holding it’s largest tournament in 2009, Pound 4. Two years after being dropped by MLG, it now has ~350 entrants. Brawl held its largest tournament in 2012 with 400 entrants in Apex 2012.”This sort of competitive circuit is very similar to bigger fighting scenes such as Street Fighter and, in fact, Smash and Street Fighter share many events.Despite the many similarities in play and culture, Smash has long been treated as the red-haired stepchild of the fighting game community.Smash is not a true 2D or 3D fighter in style or play. It is a Nintendo game, not a game by Capcom, Namco or any of the traditional fighting game developers. It has attracted an audience distinct from the traditional FGC.“The commonalities that exist are the fairly universal ones (as I’ve discovered from working/interacting with Halo, Madden, Smash, Tekken, and a few other games over the years),” wrote AlphaZealot. “Holding tournaments in people’s basements, finishing tournaments at people’s houses after the venue closes down, growing pains that go along with building a community from almost nothing, community drama, etc. The Smash community has an old saying called ‘No Johns’ which basically means ‘no excuses’. This could be similar to labeling scrubs at FGC events but to the FGC the Smash community is already scrubby because of the ruleset (banning items, stages, etc.).”AlphaZealot talked at length about the divide.“The divide goes back to at least 2003 when Melee starting picking up steam as a competitive community. This was the time when our first 100-person tournament occurred and monthly events starting popping up in many major cities. The community desperately wanted EVO to give it a try, but to no avail would they even consider running a Smash tournament. The issue and divide centered, quite simply, around Smash being ‘kiddie’ [due to its cartoonish style, Nintendo characters, distinct gameplay and separate community] and ‘not a fighter’. It was not taken seriously by the FGC and no amount of tournaments or scale of the community at that point would legitimize the game competitive.“This schism existed and continues to exist to this day. Things started to change slightly back around 2007. That year EVO ran Melee and it was their second largest attended game and had a great crowd reaction, but it wasn’t meant to last. The following year EVO ran Brawl, but put items on and the turnout barely broke 100 people. The community hated items but EVO wanted to run it their way (as opposed to the community standard – something they have claimed to advocate but did not do so in this instance). A year after EVO2k8 we were able to get Smash back as a ‘sponsored’ event (by AllisBrawl.com) in 2009 and we filled an entire 128 bracket with community standard rules.”Evo and the fighting game community at large has long held grudges against MLG, WCG and various “traditional” esports events because they have run fighting games without community input. In fact, Evo seems to have committed the same sins.In any event, Smash sustained a lucrative and serious competitive circuit through to the present day.
