# Chapter 21 - The internet (1990s)Through the 1980s, getting online generally meant connecting to specific networks with expensive fees and limited services. The networks were isolated from one another and, due in no small part to the prohibitively high cost of bandwidth, networks could barely begin to provide a significant number of gamers with the experiences they sought.The developers behind ARPAnet, the internet precursor designed by the United States military, had long held ambitions to unify global communications networks. From its 1960s inception and through the 1980s, the network grew as communication standards became uniform. Academia, industry and finally the public were given access to the network.Formerly isolated networks from around the world were soon connected and growing. By the early 90s, the foundations for the modern internet sat ready to hold the weight of one of the most significant inventions of all time.For our purposes, the 90s are important for many reasons but none are more obvious than the mainstreaming of online gaming. It is but a part of that phenomenon which has helped shrink the world to the size of a pea.
