# Chapter 10 - Space Invaders (1978)

Over the next few years, however, the VCS became increasingly popular and would become a multi billion dollar business for Atari. One key catalyst for the system’s success was the game *Space Invaders*.

*Space Invaders* began as a 1978 arcade game in Japan. The strange but true story goes like this: although the game caught on slowly, by the time *Space Invaders* truly became huge in Japan (with over 100,000 machines in operation), the government mint had to increase coin production because of a national shortage credited in large part to the arcade phenomenon.

It was the first blockbuster to originate in Japan, a country which would eventually and for some time take a leading role in the video game explosion. When the game came to America, it enjoyed more success.

*Space Invaders* is a no-win, single player game. Its gameplay and graphics are simple. In many ways, it differs deeply from the major esports titles of today. But in the golden age of arcades (the first half of the 1980s), this set the stage for the competitive gaming of the era. The personal struggles for high scores, which would be chronicled by organizations like Twin Galaxies and shown to the world in movies such as King of Kong, began with this game.

This is a title that inspired countless remakes, sequels and knock-offs. Gaming royalty such as Shigeru Miyamoto, the man behind icons such as *Mario*, *Donkey Kong*, *Zelda*, *Star Fox* and more, credit *Space Invaders* with first interesting him in video games.

“*Space Invaders* played the biggest role in revitalizing the coin-operated business,” wrote Steve Kent in the Ultimate History of Video Games.

It also marked the start of the meteoric rise of arcade games.

The years 1978 (the year *Space Invaders* was released), 1979 (*Asteroids*, *Galaxian*) and 1980 (*Pac-Man*, *Defender*, *Rally-X*) saw the arcade business blossom into a multi billion dollar industry.
