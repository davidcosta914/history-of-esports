# Chapter 31 - Halo (2001-2006)

Sports franchises such as *Madden* and *FIFA* were adopted for competitive use as online console gaming became the norm. The console FPS genre entered the fray with franchises such as *Socom* and, most importantly, *Halo*.

The first *Halo* game was released in 2001 on the Xbox. On the back of stellar gameplay and a mammoth marketing campaign from Microsoft, the franchise has repeatedly broken industry sales records. It is currently a multi billion dollar property. On the strength of the Xbox Live online gaming service, the game gave birth to a competitive scene that would eventually grow into one of the most popular in the United States during the middle of the 2000s and one which has enjoyed some success around the world.

Competitive *Halo* is generally a 4v4 team and objective-based FPS.

In 2002, Major League Gaming (MLG) was formed in the United States. Initially focused on console gaming (with *Halo 2* and *Super Smash Brothers Melee*), it became the highest peak of competitive *Halo* in America.

From the beginning of its ascent in 2004, MLG became increasingly popular with console gamers and benefited from lucrative relationships with console and game manufacturers.

The greatest team of that *Halo* era was Team 3D, named for the same organization as the historic American *Counter-Strike* Squad. More widely known as Final Boss, the team dominated *Halo 1* and *2* in a way that few if any other competitors in any franchise can match. 

Of 23 total MLG *Halo 1* and *2* events, Final Boss won 18 events and placed second at the remaining five events. The captain and greatest star on a team full of stars was David Walsh, known to the world as Walshy. Described by the American cable channel USA as "MLG’s first superstar", Walshy rose to prominence as his team dominated the earliest era of MLG *Halo* and was pushed into the public eye as a star once MLG began making inroads into more mainstream mediums such as television.

One of Team 3D’s greatest and most memorable wins came in 2005 at MLG’s national championships in New York. In the match against Team Phreaks, 3D’s experience and poise won through over a determined opposing squad.

The game mode was dubbed Oddball, a derivative of the classic capture the flag game mode described as follows by HaloWiki.net: 

>You must pick up a small skull. As you hold it, you collect time [and win when you pass the 5:00 limit]. However, be warned that your position is given away to all of your enemies on the map and while you hold it you have no attack except meleeing!

3D (including other notable *Halo* stars such as twins Daniel "OGRE1" Ryan and Tom "OGRE2" Ryan) fought for an undefeated season and a potential championship against Team Phreaks, a team with its own considerable star power-boasting players such as Scott "Gandhi" Lussier and Michael "StrongSide" Cavanaugh.

Like many big *Halo* games, the match was loud. With both teams barking commands at each other and occasionally screaming towards the other team, 3D and Phreaks traded leads for almost 9 minutes before, with just a minute left, the scores became even. Both teams were killed in entirety several times in that minute before, with just two seconds of time left (4:58 of 5:00), there was a tie. Again, both teams were able to touch the skull numerous times before being killed, leaving the crowd and players to scream and gasp and lose their voices. Finally, 3D picked up the skull for the final microsecond and the clock ticked to 5:00 giving them a historic win, one that would be remembered by *Halo* players for years. 

Just as they did in 2004, Walshy and the OGRE twins would go on to win the 2005 national championship. The team entered the 2006 season seeking a threepeat. 

In 2006, MLG secured $10 million in venture capital funding and signed a deal with USA Network to air a series of seven, hour-long shows on cable television. The shows featured MLG tournaments in *Halo 2* and *Super Smash Bros. Melee*. 

The shows would air on Saturday morning, a telling choice. Instead of aiming for young adult viewers who generally do not watch Saturday morning television due to hangovers, late night gaming or both, this time slot choice could only hope to appeal to young children as almost all Saturday morning programming does.

Walshy became a focal point for USA’s marketing of the league along with his team Final Boss and their rivals Carbon and Str8 Rippin. Final Boss was signed to MLG for $1,000,000 and Str8 Rippin’s captain Tom "Tsquared" Taylor was signed for $250,000. Considering the MLG Pro Circuit’s entire prize pool amounted to $800,000 that year, these signings were relatively enormous sums of money and showed the league’s priorities were in developing and retaining stars with major contracts as opposed to developing a prize pool that would increase the number of truly professional players and teams.

The show featuring the 2006 MLG circuit on USA Network was not renewed and, the next year, was moved to the more niche and obscure G4tv network. Again, the effort was not enough to inspire a second year. In 2008, MLG entered a co-branding and news agreement with American cable sports network ESPN but did not appear online. From 2008 on, MLG has streamed their events exclusively over the internet while hinting overtly at a desire to return to national television.

Although the United States has the marquee names and money in *Halo*, the European and Australian scenes have been growing considerably in recent years. Today, as the American *Halo* scene has shrunk considerably from prominence in the competitive world, the European scene in particular has been described by esports journalist Anne Celestino as increasingly stable and a scene which boasts a greater number of LAN events than Americans. 

Although it has shrunk from its mid-2000s glory, competitive *Halo* remains alive and kicking around the world.
