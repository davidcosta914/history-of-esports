# Chapter 43 - Nintendo supports competitive Pokemon (2008)

A significant shift took place in Nintendo’s level of support in 2008.

That year, The *Pokemon* Company International (TPCI, a new subsidiary of Nintendo) became the first organization dedicated to managing international *Pokemon* competitions. 

At around the same time, the Nintendo DS’s online capabilities were revitalizing the *Pokemon* franchise.

Thanks to a reinvigorated competitive *Pokemon* scene, Nintendo held annual Video Game Championship (VGC) tournaments all around the world from 2009 on. 

The VGC regional qualification tournaments saw upwards of 1,000 participants in 2011 and, for that number, a crowd as loud and passionate as you’ll find in most any esport. 

Top competitive *Pokemon* players can earn several thousand dollars per year in prize money in addition to other sorts of prizes. The winner of the VGC world championship gets an invite back to next year’s event and a trip for four to either New York, Hawaii or Tokyo.

The competitive *Pokemon* community is one of many competitive video games that have, for the most part, remained separate from "traditional" esports communities such as *StarCraft* and *Quake*. One of the goals of this book is to bridge that gap to whatever extent I can.
