# Chapter 42 - Team Fortress 2 (2007-2012)

Despite the popularity of the original games, *Team Fortress* went a decade without a proper sequel.

In 1996, the original *Team Fortress* mod was released for *Quake*. In 1998, *Team Fortress Classic* brought the mod to the huge *Half-Life* scene after being contracted to do so by Valve itself.

From that point, *Team Fortress 2* was said to be coming "soon" for all of eight years before it finally arrived in top form in 2007.

For much of its history, *Team Fortress Classic* was second in popularity only to *Counter-Strike*.

Now, the sequel boasts tens of thousands of players on at any given moment (54,395 as of this writing) as well as a robust but complicated competitive scene.

*Team Fortress* is a class-based shooter. It eschews realism in favor of a cartoonish game. It is one of the finest examples of why realism is not required in the least for competitive gaming. 

*TF2* emphasizes teamwork to an extent rarely seen in other competitive games. 

"I hated the game when I first started," said Sam "oPlaid" Lingle, “since basically, in a pub environment, you can’t really affect the game very much with your individual skill. In a *Counter-Strike* pub, for example, you can still end up headshotting everyone. In *TF2* it’s really hard, especially for some classes like the scout which is what I ended up playing since I like fast movement.”

The starkly contrasting classes in *TF2* rely heavily on each other, working together to accomplish goals.

When *TF2* was released, its esports potential was immediately recognized. It was a good team game with variety and depth. It was also produced by Valve, which meant that the competitive community would almost automatically give it a shot.

"There were a lot of random gamers who didn’t enjoy *CS* or were done with *CS* but still wanted to play competitively," said oPlaid. “but didn’t want to play the realism-type games. A lot of people were trying *TF2* and I ended up joining a team.”

After the early burst of popularity, the *TF2* competitive scene stabilized. Lingle’s team (Turmoil and then Pandemic) became the dominant team of the era.

Various leagues such as CEVO and LANs such as NVision and ESWC in 2008 hosted major competitions. CGS even hosted an online ProAm tournament for the game, giving the community serious reasons to hope that the game would be picked up full-time by CGS, the most important esports organization in America at that time.

"Things started looking up when CGS started to do something right and hosted the ProAm tournament," said Lingle, “which had good production and casts for an online league from CGS. They had some kind of weekly preview show that they had me go on one time. I got blacklisted from this place I always order food from because the driver was really slow and ended up reaching my door just as I got the call to go on [the CGS show].”

The CGS died around the day of the ProAm finals.

*Team Fortress 2* still boasts an active competitive scene but has faces significant hurdles in growing it. For a competitive title, the game’s timing was simply unlucky.

"I think if things had dropped differently, *TF2* could’ve been a really successful esport," said oPlaid. “But it didn’t work out. Or at least it hasn’t.”

After the CPL closed up shop shortly after *TF2*’s release, the CGS became the most important esports organization in the US. As opposed to the CPL, which was relatively open to adding new games to its events, the CGS was a closed environment. There was simply no room for *TF2* until it was too late.

Like many slightly older competitive games, *TF2* narrowly missed out on the streaming explosion that has played such a huge role in popularizing modern esports. Even today, streaming *TF2 *is relatively rare due to the toll it takes on CPU performance.

One of the most talked about issues is Valve’s business model with *TF2*.

The game became free-to-play in 2011, a move that has served to boost the game’s playing population considerably. The game is now monetized by in-game purchases such as weapons and, most notoriously, hats.

"The way Valve runs things makes it difficult too since they add random items that can’t really be used competitively," said oPlaid, “because they either suck or are overpowered. So how do you manage all of that stuff?”

A growing list of banned items has created a gulf between the competitive and casual communities.

"It’s a different game than is what is played in pubs," said oPlaid, “so that makes it harder for people to get in. Though I don’t think this is as big a deal as some people make it out to be.”

As Valve currently experiments with other competitive titles such as *Dota 2*, the hope among the *Team Fortress* faithful is that they will be more willing to experiment with more competitive features in *TF2* such as tournament mode.
