# Chapter 13 - Battlezone (1980)

1980 saw the release of *Battlezone *by Atari, a tank warfare game. If *Maze Wars* and *Spasim *invented the first-person shooter genre, *Battlezone *is what brought it to the attention of the American public.

1UP.com summed it up, writing,

>While [Atari Programmer and Battlezone Designer Ed] Rotberg probably can't be credited with creating the [FPS] idea, it was his tank game which set the standard. Battlezone was a case of the right game at the right time: an innovative step forward in game design offered to a public hungry for something new and sophisticated. Early games were in a lot of ways a learning process for gamers as much as for the designers who made them; as arcade-goers mastered basic gameplay concepts, they graduated to more intricate forms of action.

In introducing admittedly basic 3D FPS gameplay, *Battlezone *set the stage for the mammoth genre that produced blockbuster after blockbuster in the 1990s and 2000s and would become the premiere esports genre in the Western world for much of that time.

One of the most talked-about anecdotes surrounding the popular game started when retired American generals contacted Atari about creating a version of the game to help train soldiers. The game’s designer, Ed Rotberg, was profoundly displeased with the attention he received from the military.

>You’ve got to remember what things were like in the late 1970s, and where those of us who were in the business came from - our cultural background,” he said in The Ultimate History of Video Games. “Those of us who found our way to video games … it was sort of a counter-culture thing. We didn’t want anything to do with the military.

Nonetheless, Military *Battlezone*, a much more realistic and complex version of the game, was created much to the consternation of Rotberg.

The FPS was gaining the attention and the money of the video game playing world and, whether it liked it or not, beyond.
