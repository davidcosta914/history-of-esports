# Chapter 56 - Outro

Virgin Gaming recently announced that they, in partnership with EA DICE, will be holding what they say will undoubtedly be the largest console game tournament ever, with their *Battlefield 3* World Conquest 2012 tournament. No official dates have been announced yet but has been announced for 'early' 2012, so it's surely right around the corner.

There will be over $1.6 million in cash prizes awarded as well as so many live, action-soaked events that attendees and competitors will be able to add another favorite to their ever-growing list of superb eSport tournaments around the world.

A decade ago, a handful of young people talked into shoddy microphones and described in detail the game of *Quake* to anyone who would listen. Team Sportscast Network and Inside the Game promoted personalities like djWHEAT whose love of the game was obvious and infectious.

Technology has moved a mile forward since the beginning of the millenium. Now, services such as Ustream, LiveStream, Own3d and TwitchTV provide easy access to the software needed to reach millions of fans with just a few minutes of set up.

The best players in the world can get tens of thousands of viewers to tune in to watch them practice. The advertising revenue is a significant complement to their salary and prize winnings In some cases, it makes up the vast majority of their income.

The biggest tournaments in the world attract hundreds of thousands of viewers at a time regularly and millions of viewers in total. Major League Gaming, Global *StarCraft* League, Evolution Championship Series, DreamHack, Intel Extreme Masters and more have attracted the gaze of the world. Valve’s *Dota 2* Invitational (an admittedly exceptional event as it was the event in which the game was revealed to the world) reached over a million viewers at the same time.

Outside of the cozy esports bubble, outlets that normally cover mainstream gaming such as Kotaku, PC Gamer and Rock Paper Shotgun have taken notice of esports’ growth. Even more important, mainstream outlets such as Forbes and The Economist are now paying serious attention to our silly games.

It is incredibly easy to be caught up in the frenzy but if we are going to build a real industry, we have to learn the lessons of the past.  Sustainability is paramount and so we cannot be tempted by the quick and easy payday. Television, I’m looking at you. Or, more accurately, I’m not looking at you.

Treating the players fairly is important. They are human beings, not commodities. Anyway, they are better commodities when you treat them like human beings.

Choosing and sticking with tried and true esports is important because no bribe from a publisher can override the fact that the community knows best in the long run.

We have come a long way from 2000. Hell, we’ve come a long way even from 2008. As you’ve read, this plateau we’ve reached does not mean we are in for clear skies and sunny weather from here on out. With few exceptions, whatever profits do exist come from sponsors, a notoriously fickle species.

The most important player in the esports game remains the community. For all the millions of dollars floating this way and that, the community is the arbiter which will decide the greater success or failure of esports. Fighting games, shooters, strategy games and nearly every truly successful esport has grown from a grassroots community effort even when the developers give up.

Moving forward, know that esports is ours and not theirs. Good luck and have fun with it.

This project is for everyone who has jammed a B button in frustration and for everyone who has cracked the X button in triumph. This is for the keyboard breakers, late night players and 5am insomniacs with just one more game to go, the 5pm workaholics with time for just one game and the masses who keep coming back by the millions. This is for the sober, studious, ambitious kids of all ages with dreams of being the best in the world at what they love. This is for the not-so-sober, the unwinding, the gamers of all ages who simply want to play.

If, as Chris Sullentop wrote in the New York Times, “Video games have created what must be the biggest generation gap since rock ’n’ roll” then this a rough map of my home by this grand canyon.

In the hope of explaining ourselves a little better by explaining our pastimes as best we can, I wrote this.

This is for the millions of fans who make competitive gaming what it is.
