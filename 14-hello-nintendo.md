# Chapter 14 - Hello, Nintendo (1981)

In 1981, a small Japanese games company struggled to establish a foothold in the American market. After several failures, their American salesmen were on the brink of bankruptcy. With funds extremely low, Nintendo brought *Donkey Kong* to America.

The game, the first creation of Shigeru Miyamoto, would go on to sell 67,000 units according to Eddie Adlum of RePlay Magazine. It became a cultural phenomenon in the United States. "Do the Donkey Kong" by Buckner & Garcia, of “Pac-Mac Fever” fame, hit #103 on the Billboard charts.

The game’s success was huge and its legacy is immense. 

It is the first appearance of Donkey Kong and Mario, two of the most iconic video game characters of all time. It was the launching pad for Nintendo of America, a company which would be a major player and then come to dominate American and global video games in several years. It began the game design career of Shigeru Miyamoto, a man who reigns as arguably the most important and respected designer of all time.

After a string of misses, the major hit *Donkey Kong *laid the foundation for the originality, playfulness and overall aesthetic that would come to define Nintendo’s games. Later, *Donkey Kong* would also significantly help the cause of Nintendo’s first home console, the release of which ranks high on a list of the most important moments in video game history.

Like many of the hit games at the time, it became a major focus of competitive gamers striving to earn a high score and a world record. The struggle to claim supremacy continues today: recent record-breaking performances were chronicled in the 2007 documentary "King of Kong: A Fistful of Quarters."

Billy Mitchell (born 1965) is a golden age legend. Mitchell’s gaming accomplishments include the first perfect game of *Pac-Man*, high scores in games such as *Donkey Kong Jr., BurgerTime* and *Centipede *and being dubbed the greatest arcade gamer of all time and the greatest gamer of the century by major media outlets and, most often, by himself. Mitchell, a Massachusetts native, held the world record for *Donkey Kong* with a score of 874,300 for over two decades. 

His showy blend of arrogance, confidence and ultra-competitive behavior has made him a celebrity and, often, a villain in the competitive gaming world and beyond. He is almost certainly the first of his kind, a man who attracted wider attention not just for his gaming but for being a self-aggrandizing player, a self-promotional workhorse and an intelligently self-forged commodity in and of himself.

Billy Mitchell was one of two main characters featured in King of Kong. Steve Wiebe, the other featured competitor in the film and a major rival of Mitchell’s, would finally break Mitchell’s record by almost 200,000 with a score of 1,049,100 in 2007.

The popularity of the Wiebe/Mitchell rivalry has survived despite both players’ scores being surpassed by New Yorker Hank Chien. 

The personal dynamic between Wiebe and Mitchell is so engaging and dramatic that Seth Gordon, the director of King of Kong, said, in an interview with TheFilmlot.com, that the "archetypes of Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker are very present … It’s unbelievable. Billy is such a good gamer that when he’s finished beating the games, he moves on to play games with people."

This rivalry has helped renew and sustain interest in competitive gaming for classic arcade games through multiple decades.
