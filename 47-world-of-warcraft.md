# Chapter 47 - World of Warcraft (2004-2010)

Outside of the mostly major esports mentioned thus far, many other games have been used in competitions. Several were simply then-popular games forced into esports service by shortsighted organizations that were sure they’d strike gold. Other games have been played competitively to such an extent as to warrant a mention here.

*World of Warcraft* is the most successful MMORPG of all time by far and a major part of why the world’s largest publisher, Activision Blizzard, has more money than they know what to do with. 

In esports, *WoW* pitted players’ customizable RPG-style characters against one another in arenas in team battles to the death. During the latter half of the 2000s, *WoW* arena was featured in leagues such as MLG and IEM. 

"The MLG PC circuit was first created in May of 2008 and had a very huge following," wrote hydrolis at sk-gaming.com. “The MLG tournaments quickly became the backbone of North-American WoW arena competition with thousands of people tuning into live streams of the matches.”

wow in my book is summed up in a short section that basically says: the game was huge. because it had so many commited players, a competitive niche emerged. it went on to become fairly big for a time, mlg's biggest game by quite a bit but that was mainly due to wow's popularity more than anything else. the game is not well suited to be an esport. when the game's popularity sputtered, the esport died, thus proving that point.

During its two year run, *WoW* had broken most of MLG’s viewing records and was, for a time, its most popular game. However, the esport’s popularity was due to *WoW*’s popularity more than anything else. The game itself is not well suited to be an esport.

By 2010, the popularity of the game slid considerably. The competitive side of the game sputtered and stalled thus proving that there is relatively little of substance to the esport, no matter how crack-like the game itself can be.
