# Chapter 40 - The Street Fighter renaissance (2008)Released in 2008, Street Fighter 4 has been one of the most important esports titles of all time. Arriving just as many corners of competitive gaming were collapsing, the new Street Fighter signaled the renaissance of the mostly autonomous fighting game scene.“I certainly didn't expect the massive wave of popularity that came with SF4,” said Inkblot on Reddit. “In many ways SF4 was the perfect game at the right time. It appealed to the older generation's sense of nostalgia. It was simple enough for newer players and fans to pickup and understand quickly. It was deep enough to establish a high level of competitive play.”“Street Fighter 4 attracted a whole new generation of players,” said Henry Cen, owner of the largest fighting game arcade in New York City (Next Level), “[SF4 succeeded] based on brand familiarity and relatively good gameplay compared to other titles in the recent past.”Cen has been a fixture in the fighting game community since the 90s and the days of New York’s legendary Chinatown Fair arcade. When Chinatown Fair closed in 2011, Cen opened Next Level in Brooklyn. The closing was important enough to warrant a feature piece in the New York Times.“Instead of a crowded warren of consoles, perfumed by three decades of adrenaline, it is an antiseptic space decorated with nothing more than white sheetrock,” wrote Ariel Kaminer in the Times. “Instead of sitting amid the dense bustle of Mott Street [where Chinatown Fair sat], it occupies the first floor of a modest residential building on a quiet street in Sunset Park, Brooklyn. And instead of a broad spectrum of games, dating all the way back to the venerable Ms. Pac Man, it has, at the moment, exactly eight. The emphasis is on those same ultracool fighting games that so dazzled the cognoscenti on Mott Street, and which, it turns out, Mr. Cen had purchased for Chinatown Fair with his own money, at around $10,000 apiece.”“Fighting games attract one thing: people that want to be respected,” Mr. Cen said to Kaminer. “There’s a lot of people in life that don’t get respected for a lot of things they do. So they have this pent-up anger, then they walk in the arcade, they play a fighting game, and if they beat someone, they gain their respect. And with that, it builds camaraderie. Respect is the most important thing in life.”Next Level was designed specifically to advance fighting games as an esport (even if they’d never use that exact term). When I visited on a Wednesday night in fall, it was filled with talkative Next Level natives eating Chinese food and getting ready for the biweekly Street Fighter 4 tournament. Although they didn’t know who I was, I was given a friendly greeting by several people in between their long and deep dissertations on intricacies of fighting games, most of which were laced with the sort of casual and creative profanity that let me know I was home.When one player complained about a newcomer’s aggressive style, the only consolation a friend could offer in return was this: “Ain’t nothing you can do about that bullshit.”“No one cares how you win,” said Cen, “just how you look when you lose.”“It may help to win gamers new found respect,” wrote Kaminer in the New York Times, “but it does not sound like the kind of place where a passersby with a moment to kill would amble in and lose a few quarters.”Indeed, it is not a classic arcade in that way. It is built for competition first.The Street Fighter renaissance has been felt around the world. The California fighting game scene, long the most active and competitive in the United States, has felt a surge of new competitors. Evo, the premiere fighting game tournament held annually in Las Vegas, is attracting record numbers of participants and online viewers, growing significantly each year.Japan remains the preeminent country in Street Fighter. While America’s arcade culture has largely disappeared with the rare exception such as Henry Cen’s Next Level arcade, Japan possesses a stronger arcade scene. Although even Japanese arcades are not as prominent as they once were, the relatively small size of the country and the high population density has meant that more arcades have been able to survive and thrive in Japan.With more arcades, players are able to face each other without dealing with the considerable variables of online play. Latency diminishes competition in all games and its effect on fighting games is especially profound when a split second can mean the difference between a hit and a miss, a win and a loss. As is the case with almost all esports, every major fighting game tournament takes place in person, offline. The Japanese, because of their arcade culture, are more thoroughly used to this environment.There is no competitor in esports who has remained at the top of his game nearly as long as Daigo Umehara has. If his rise to international stardom in the 90s was not enough, if his role in some of the most iconic moments in esports history was not enough, then surely his role as the recurring antagonist at each year’s Evolution Championship Series must be enough to justify to the heaps of praise and respect he receives from every corner of the globe.Evo has grown from dozens of competitors in the 90s to thousands now, boasting millions of viewers and some of the most loved events in all of competitive gaming. As the competitive scene has undergone booms and busts, Evo has occupied a unique and continued space in the gaming world.Likewise, Daigo has been an immovable object at the top of the fighting game world, at once a man and a mountain and “globally known as the biggest legend in fighting game history. Countless world titles spanning multiple games, [the most] clutch moments in fighting game history and a fighting game spirit second to none - you name it, he’s done it and he’s not even close to finishing it yet,” wrote yoooooon on Shoryuken.com.In 2009, Daigo advanced to the Street Fighter 4 finals at Evo against his “perennial American opponent” Justin Wong in a marquee match up that would almost certainly not live up to the monumental hype. After all, how could it live up to two of the most famous names in fighting?On the contrary, as Evo gained greater attention than ever before and in the brightest spotlight of their career, the fight was electric.Although Daigo opened the match with a convincing win, Wong (who came out of the losers bracket) switched characters at the urging of the rowdy as per usual crowd (chanting “Switch! Switch! Switch!”). With a uniquely handled Balrog, a character that was much less common in Japan than in the US, Wong was able to blindside Umehara much to the delight of the increasingly loud crowd.With a 2-1 lead, Daigo momentarily figured out Wong’s unusual play. The Beast was able to tie the series up.After some uncharacteristic major mistakes from Umehara, Wong took the fight to the wire and defeated Daigo 3-2.Because Wong came from the losers bracket, Justin’s victory simply reset the bracket. One last series would have to be played to decide the 2008 champion. By this time, Daigo had figured out Wong’s play enough to claim a razor thin 3-2 victory after another back and forth series. The American fans could do little but cheer as the Japanese champion claimed another crown. That fight was featured in the fighting game documentary “I Got Next” as the climax.“[Competing] is a process like piling a round stone one after another, very carefully and creatively,” said Daigo in an interview with Shoryuken.com. “I enjoy a process of challenging myself. I set goals for myself. I identify what’s missing in myself and find out what I need to do in order to reach the goal. That revelation and growth process is so valuable to me. For me to play a game means trying something new and pushing myself to a new boundary. It’s not whether I can win, throw a cool combo, or just simply have fun with it. So it has nothing to do with what others think of me or my play, but how I feel. I keep pushing myself, and that’s all there is. I don’t compare myself with others. My inspiration and drive comes from my internal desire of wanting to challenge myself. I think that’s what people see in me as a competitive person.”Today, the fighting game community is one of the most unique scenes in esports. Fighting games are in vogue in a way they have not been since the early 90s. Fighting games’ uniquely deep and rich history combined with their immediately electric appeal has bridged a gap between old and new.The fighting game community has built one of the premiere esports on the planet. Somehow defying time, Daigo (who would also win Evo 2010 and then place top 4 in 2011) is still its greatest star.
