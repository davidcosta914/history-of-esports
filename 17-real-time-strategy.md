# Chapter 17 - Real Time Strategy (1981-1989)The 1980s saw the creation and refinement of a number of genres important to esports. One of the most significant competitive genres of all time has been real time strategy (RTS).Before RTS games, the ancestry of the genre can be traced back to war games. In particular, Eastern Front (1941) was a 1981 title on Atari 8-bit systems. Prior to this game, turn based war games were the rule with little to no exception.With Eastern Front, combatants (playing either Germany or Russia) made their military decisions at separate times but had them play out on screen simultaneously, thus simulating real time strategy play as well as the technology of the time could muster.The first true proto-RTS game was spotted in the wild in 1982 on the Intellivision console. Designer Don Daglow, widely acknowledged as one of the most important game designers of all time, and Mattel (now the world’s most profitable toy company) created and published Utopia thus laying the foundations for a genre which remains robust and successful to this day and has been at the forefront of competitive gaming since the 1990s.In Utopia, players owned one of two islands and aimed to please their citizens by planting crops, building houses and funding rebel activity on their opponent’s island. Over the course of your ‘term of office’, the player had to choose his or her course wisely and quickly in order to outwit and outscore an opponent.Throughout the decade, the genre crawled forward. Titles such as Stonkers (1983) attempted to bring real time war to home computers. Stonkers itself was plagued with slow gameplay and all too common software errors but nevertheless won some praise for its interesting concepts.The Ancient Art of War (1984) was a considerably more successful take on the genre. It focused on the tactics of a small, ancient battle as players tried to adjust army composition and formations in order to claim victory.Herzog Zwei (1989) was the first game to meet most of the tenets of the modern RTS genre.  In Herzog Zwei, you control a single fighter jet. Through it, you purchase units and issue basic commands as you wage real time war against your opponent. As your tanks, jets and missiles are launched at your enemy, its easy to recognize the game as a living and breathing precursor to the modern RTS genre.Herzog Zwei is remembered as one of the best multiplayer Sega Genesis titles of all time.It would take one more landmark game in 1992 before the RTS genre fully arrived at its present form.
