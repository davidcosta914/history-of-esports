# Chapter 08 - The Fighter (1976)In 1976, the fighting game genre began to emerge.Heavyweight Champ, a black and white arcade title by Sega, is widely credited as the first side-scrolling fighter.Spanner Spencer at EuroGamer.net wrote this about the game:>“SEGA, at the time, seemed to concentrate more on developing imaginative control systems rather than gameplay (something which has certainly worked for Nintendo recently, it must be said). The black and white boxing game employed two ‘boxing glove’ controllers (one each for the two players) which moved up and down for high and low punches, with an inward movement for striking. While the controllers were a decent enough gimmick, the actual on-screen match wasn't much more than an unresponsive cross between a Punch & Judy performance and a pixellated episode of the Black & White Minstrel Show.”From here, there was little cause to immediately celebrate in the genre but a few swings and misses. Eventually, the early 1980s would see the growth and evolution of a genre which would rise to primacy in the early 90s.
