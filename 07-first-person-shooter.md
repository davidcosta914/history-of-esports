# Chapter 7 - The First Person Shooter (1974)MIT’s Tech Model Railroad Club was home to 1962’s landmark video game Spacewar! on the PDP-1 computer. This game is but one important step in the tradition of home computing.While arcade manufacturers dealt with the often cutthroat market reality, those in academia had the liberty to imagine and develop freely without actively worrying about the bottom line.The 70s saw a number of experiments in computer gaming, some of no consequence and some advancing the medium permanently.Text simulations such as Eliza (a 1966 game that simulated a conversation with a psychiatrist), Adventure (a 1976 text based adventure game) and, famously, Zork (a 1977 fantasy adventure) advanced ‘natural language’, the computer’s ability to use and communicate in language understandable by the layman.In 1974, the first steps were taken toward first-person shooters (FPS). The FPS is a genre that has come to represent some of the most financially, critically and competitively successful titles of all time.The advent of the genre came with two 1974 titles: Maze War and Spasim.Maze War allowed one or multiple players (represented by floating eyes and connected via Ethernet) to travel through a large maze and attempt to find and kill opponents.Spasim (short for space simulation) was a 32-player flight simulator played over the PLATO Network at several American universities.These games represent pioneering efforts in video games as well as computer networking. Both were chiefly academic rather than commercial pursuits. Young interns wrote Maze War at NASA’s Ames Research Center. Spasim was written at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.Maze War creator Steve Colley described the development of his game:“In 1973 I was trying to do simple 3D displays on the Imlac PDS-1. The first one I did was a simple rotating cube in which the hidden lines of the wireframe cube were removed. The complexity was in doing the sines and cosines on a slow machine with no multiply or divide.“A little later I had the idea of doing a maze where you were actually in the maze. To keep it simple, it had an array of 16X16 bits to define the maze. I worked out how to display the halls of the maze with perspective (apparently unchanged to today), and it worked quite fast so you could quickly move around in the maze. There was no way to display an overview of the maze, and you were to simply explore the maze and ‘solve’ it. I had several different maze designs, and it was surprising how quickly you could learn them.“Maze was popular at first but quickly became boring. Then someone (Howard or Greg) had the idea to put people in the maze. To do this would take more than one Imlac, which at that time were not networked together. So we connected two Imlacs using the serial ports to transmit locations back and forth. This worked great, and soon the idea for shooting each other came along, and the first person shooter was born.”Kristin Reed at VideoGamesDaily.com wrote this about the two trailblazing games:“Although their wireframe graphics and slow frame rates make them look extremely primitive even by early videogame [sic] standards, they nevertheless provided a few lucky students with a glimpse into an entertainment future that would engross millions.”Although the genre’s immediate impact in the gaming industry was limited (NASA did find uses for it), the 1980s saw adoption and experimentation with the idea. It would take almost 20 years for the genre to explode in the 1990s.
